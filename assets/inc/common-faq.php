<button class="accordion">What if it doesn't work for me?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.

Of course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.</p>

<button class="accordion">What do I do about the materials from other similar programs?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The wonderful thing about all of our products is that each of them can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.

Individualogist's collection of materials seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.</p>
