            <h2>But There's More To Your Element Than Just That, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Your element comprises so much more… It reveals aspects of who you are that lie far <span class="purple">beyond your personality.</span></p>

        <p>That’s because elements are essential to <span class="purple">all facets of life…</span> The information revealed in your Element can be integrated into your consciousness.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you already know this, but allow me to explain what this means in a little bit more detail.</p>

        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, although each of us has a <span class="purple">prominent element</span> that controls the majority of our personality, the process of integrating all four Elements into your consciousness can create stupendous changes in your life…</p>
        
        <ul class="bullet-purple">
            <li>A newfound sense of <span class="goldenrod">wholeness</span></li>
            <li>A perfect <span class="goldenrod">balance</span> in your personal aura</li>
            <li>Forging closer and better <span class="goldenrod">relationships</span> with lovers, loved ones, and strangers</li>
            <li>Gaining an <span class="goldenrod">enlightened perspective</span> on the differences of individuals around you</li>
            <li>A magnetizing personality that will attract <span class="goldenrod">infinite luck, opportunities, and joy</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="ep-sub-header">
            <h2>Everything You've Ever And Never Seen Is Derived From Elements, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>That’s right, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… The spectrum of Elements extends far beyond what we know as “consciousness”. Elements have a presence in literally <span class="purple">all things, and all matter.</span></p>

        <p>Literally the <span class="purple">entire cosmos</span> is formed from materials and particles that are derived from Elements…</p>

        <p>…That includes your Dreams, Desires, and Purpose.</p>

        <p>And recognising this indisputable fact is just the <span class="purple">first step towards developing spiritual consciousness.</span></p>

        <p>In other words, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, becoming aware of Elements is just the first of many steps that are about to enfold…</p>

        <p>…And it’s unfolding before you, right in front of your very eyes… Yes, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. It’s happening <span class="purple">right now.</span></p>
        
        <div class="ep-sub-header">
            <h2>The Formation Of All Materials</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>The elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth, are merely manifested forms of the entire concept of Elements.

        <p>Their manifestations are as follows…

        <p>The element of <span class="purple">Water</span> has magnetic properties; it nurtures and sustains.</p>

        <p>The element of <span class="purple">Fire</span> has electrifying, commanding, and creative properties.</p>

        <p>The element of <span class="purple">Air</span> is a detaching element and enables co-existence of the two main elements, fire and water.</p>

        <p>The element of <span class="purple">Earth</span> binds fire, water and air in various proportions, which is what ultimately makes possible the formation of different materials to begin with.</p>

        <p>It’s a little bit difficult to comprehend, but stay with me here, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… Perhaps this illustration will explain things a little clearer…</p>

        <p>Let’s illustrate the elements in action with the illustration of a <span class="purple">tree…</span></p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/ep-1.png">
        
        <p>A tree’s roots <span class="purple">absorb Water and minerals</span> necessary for growth from Earth (the elements of water and earth).</p>

        <p>The tree <span class="purple">breathes Air</span> through its leaves (the element of air)…</p>

        <p>And <span class="purple">receives light and warmth</span> from sunbeams (the element of fire).</p>

        <p>If you set the wood of a tree on fire, the elements would be released from it.</p>

        <p>The water will evaporate, the light that has shone on the tree for many long years will burn out in a mighty flame, the oxygen the tree has been “breathing out” will enable this energy process of burning and nutrients from the soil will turn into ash, which will again serve as <span class="purple">a source of minerals</span> for other forms of life.</p>
        
        <p>Now, let’s apply that illustration to ourselves, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> – our actual, human <span class="purple">selves.</span></p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/ep-2.png">

        <p>From what we’ve understood thus far, elements that form the <span class="purple">material world</span> are also included in an <span class="purple">individual’s personality…</span></p>

        <p>This is, of course, dependent on which element is the most dominant within you – as dictated by your <span class="purple">Star Sign.</span></p>

        <p>Based on that information, you <span class="purple">could</span> have a melancholic, detached, and unemotional nature… Or, your nature could also be overflowing with <span class="purple">life, energy, and positivity.</span></p>

        <p>Each of these natures is important, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> – especially when it comes to interaction and relationships…</p>

        <p>It allows us to witness an individual, a situation, a “matter”, from all perspectives… Sounds a lot, like consciousness, doesn’t it, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>?</p>

        <p>But, here’s the thing, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>The interpretation of Elements has <span class="purple">deviated FAR from</span> the original script.</p>

        <p>They’ve been tainted with the <span class="purple">toxicity of time,</span> and each of the four Elements have either been painted with a brush of goodness, or vandalized with darkness.</p>

        <p>The truth is, each of the four elements is <span class="purple">inherently neutral.</span></p>

        <p>No element is good. And no element is bad.</p>

        <p>This is the fault of both time and man – the culprits who’ve labelled elements as such – even though it’s far from the truth.</p>

        <p>And I know that’s REALLY important to you, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… I’m sure you want to know the truth just as much as I do, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, it’s the truth that grants us <span class="purple">spiritual freedom…</span> And it’s the truth that will grant us emotional development.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you’ve already understood this by now, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>Elements form the very core of what we know as existence.</p>
        
        <div class="ep-sub-header">
            <h2><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, What Exactly Are You Lacking?</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>We’ve spoken about your individual qualities as seen in your Element, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… How did it make you feel?</p>

        <p>Did it make you feel empowered? Or did it make you feel as if you were lacking in certain areas?</p>

        <p>I want you to be <span class="purple">completely transparent</span> with yourself right now. How does knowing about your element really make you feel? Think about it for a second, and then say the answer out loud, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>…Ready? This is what it means…</p>

        <p>Your answer indicates how developed you are as a human spirit… And also, the number of qualities you’ve already developed through experience.</p>

        <p>Fascinating, isn’t it, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>?</p>

        <p>Regardless, I want you to know that you <span class="purple">possess infinite potential,</span> <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… Infinite potential to attain perfection. Infinite potential to <span class="purple">transform</span> all <span class="purple">negativities</span> into qualities that emit <span class="purple">pure positivity.</span></p>

        <p>Yes, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… You truly do have that capacity…</p>
        
        <div class="ep-sub-header">
            <h2>And That Path Is Revealed In Your Elemental Paradigm</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Elemental Paradigm is a complete report that we’ve prepared for you, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>It’s a revealing and insightful reading that examines your Element in agonising detail…</p>

        <p>That includes…</p>
        
        <ul class="bullet-purple">
            <li>A complete breakdown and explanation of your Element’s role in your personality</li>
            <li>An in-depth look into your wealth and career insights based on your personal strengths</li>
            <li>A clear path towards spiritual development that’s been paved just for you</li>
            <li>An insightful guide to your personal, professional, and romantic relationships</li>
            <li>A revealing forecast about your future struggles, victories, and milestones</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your Elemental Paradigm consists of all that, and more… And the best part?</p>

        <p>All of your <span class="purple">questions, uncertainties, and curiosities</span> are answered within your Elemental Paradigm.</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever wondered about what the future holds for you…</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever wondered about the limitless potential of your Element’s personality…</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever wondered what more you could achieve if you truly tried…</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever wondered about your personal path and direction…</p>

        <p>All of those answers could be right on its way to your inbox right now, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>…This is a chance for you to finally attain that <span class="purple">unquestionable sense of understanding</span> about everything that’s happened and will happen in your life.</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/ep-3.png">

        <p>This is the opportunity that you really need to seize. But you absolutely must act quickly, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>…Because every second the passes, we’re receiving hundreds of requests from other individuals… Far more than what we can handle.</p>

        <p>…And these requests are coming from individuals who are ready to take massive action – individuals who have <span class="purple">already decided that they’re ready to make an enormous change</span> in their life.</p>

        <p>And unfortunately, we cannot process that many requests…</p>

        <p>Which also means that your opportunity to <span class="purple">receive your Elemental Paradigm</span> might no longer be available within the next hour or two.</p>

        <p>Everyone has a free choice, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>And everyone also has the choice to decide how they intend to use the power of their Element, how they choose to develop certain qualities within themselves…</p>

        <p>But if you choose not to explore your Element, you <span class="purple">bear the risk</span> of resuming the remainder of your life engulfed with <span class="purple">untransformed, negative traits</span> that will continue to reside within your personality…</p>

        <p>And when that happens, you can <span class="purple">no longer wonder</span> whether you could have <span class="purple">soared to greater heights,</span> or whether you could have done better in certain aspects of your life… or whether you <span class="purple">could have been the person</span> that you were truly <span class="purple">meant to be.</span></p>

        <p>I don’t want that to happen, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… And I know for a fact that <span class="purple">you’d hate for that to happen</span> too…</p>

        <p>BUT. There’s always light at the end of every tunnel. So, here’s the good news!</p>

        <p>If you’re being held back by financial obligations – you have nothing to worry about. Because…</p>

        <p>Your Elemental Paradigm has been <span class="purple">DISCOUNTED</span> – just for you, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>…And quite a hefty discount, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you’re wondering…</p>

        <p>“Why am I getting a discount? What did I do?”</p>

        <p>Well, because just like you, I too belong to the same Earth element! And I’ve decided to extend this discount to just a <span class="purple">handful of people</span> who belong to that same element.</p>

        <p>So, instead of paying the full price of $67 for your Elemental Paradigm…</p>

        <p>Your discounted price… Contingent on you taking action in the next 1 hour… Will be just <strike>$47</strike> <span class="purple">$19.</span></p>

        <p>I know, I know… It’s a little bit biased, isn’t it? But I’m only human… And humans feel connected to others who remind them of themselves… Don’t you agree, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>?</p>

        <p>So, do take advantage of this <span class="purple">metamorphic, transformative opportunity,</span> <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… Because I have a really good feeling that you’re going to benefit from this – more than others.</p>
        
        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, I have <span class="purple">absolute confidence</span> that your Elemental journey will be nothing short of <span class="purple">fulfilling and enlightening…</span></p>
