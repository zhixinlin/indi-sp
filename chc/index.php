    <div class="chc-reading">
        <p>Dear <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>,</p>

        <p>Crystals possess <span class="purple">great healing powers…</span></p>
        
        <p>Healing powers that are so potent, that even science itself is unable to comprehend the <span class="purple">true magnitude of the energy found within crystals…</span></p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/chc-img1.png">
        
        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, one of the earliest pieces of evidence of the <span class="purple">healing properties of crystals</span> was discovered by a scientist at IBM – Marcel Vogel.</p>
        
        <p>As he patiently observed the growth of crystals under a microscope, he realized that the crystals were <span class="purple">taking the form and shape</span> of whatever came to his mind…</p>
        
        <p>I won’t bore you with the details, but Marcel believed this had to do with the bonds between the molecules and their vibrations.</p>
        
        <p>But in order to gain more conclusive results, he actually tested and managed to <span class="purple">prove that crystals were able to STORE THOUGHTS</span> – almost similar to how magnetic energy is able to record and store sounds!</p>
        
        <p>Fascinating, isn’t it, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>?</p>
        
        <p>…But that’s NOT the ONLY piece of evidence about the power of crystals, Friend…</p>
        
        <p>Albert Einstein once said that everything in life revolves around vibrations…</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/chc-img2.png">
        
        <p>…Sound waves, thoughts, energy – everything that’s manifested and materialized in our lives. And this came from the greatest and most <span class="purple">brilliant mind</span> to have ever set foot on the face of the Earth! How awesome is that?</p>
        
        <p>Which means to say, that when you REALLY think about it, crystals are sort of a catalyst… When you project your thoughts into crystals, it <span class="purple">amplifies those vibrations</span> to produce healing properties!</p>
        
        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, just imagine the miracles and amazing feats you’d be able to perform by tapping into this source of healing!</p>
        
        <p>BUT… It’s not JUST about healing, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. When you’ve mastered the art of crystals, you can do so much more. You could…</p>
        
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Bloodstone</span> to improve your vitality and spiritual energy…</p>
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Smoky Quartz</span> to transmute negative energy into positive vibrations…</p>
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Rose Quartz</span> to open up and heal the energy of your heart…</p>
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Carnelian</span> to magnetize abundance, wealth, and fortune…</p>
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Celestite</span> to experience tranquility and harmony from within…</p>
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Citrine</span> to maintain a permanent positive state of mind…</p>
        <p>…Use <span class="purple">Aventurine</span> to overcome mental blockades and limiting beliefs…</p>
        <p>…And so, so, so MUCH more, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>When you REALLY think about it, the possibilities are practically ENDLESS.</p>

        <p>…But remember, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, this isn’t just metaphysics – this is real. This is a proven idea – not a theory.</p>

        <p>In fact, crystal healing has been used for almost <span class="purple">6,000 YEARS!</span> The use of crystals for healing purposes dates back to the ancient times of the Egyptians, and traces back to olden asian cultures – most notably the in the Chinese belief of <span class="purple">Chi, or life energy.</span></p>
        
        <h2 class="chc-sub-header">Even More Indisputable Evidence Of <span class="purple">Crystals</span> And Its Miracles</h2>
        
        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… I get it. Naysayers tempt to dismiss the effects of crystals as merely a “placebo”… BUT. What they fail to consider is the indisputable fact that quartz crystal has properties such as <span class="purple">piezoelectricity</span>, through which its six sides alternate a positive and negative charge under certain conditions.</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/chc-img3.png">
        
        <p>It is also an indisputable fact that quartz can <span class="purple">store huge amounts of data,</span> and that crystals are used in a number of life-changing technologies – think about our watches, our computers chips, and even our cars!</p>
        
        <p>And thanks to quantum physics, science has <span class="purple">finally accepted what metaphysicians have been saying</span> all along…</p>
        
        <p>“Everything is energy. Energy can be <span class="purple">transmuted and changed.</span> Everything vibrates.”</p>
        
        <p>In fact, it is also understood that crystal healing is even possible across <span class="purple">time and space.</span></p>
        
        <h2 class="chc-sub-header"><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, All Of This Is Revealed In Your <span class="purple">Crystal Healing Chronicles...</span></h2>
        
        <p>Now that we’ve gone through the facts, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it’s time to answer the question that you’ve been waiting for…</p>
        
        <p>“How on earth can I become a master practitioner of crystal healing?”</p>
        
        <p>First of all, it is <span class="purple">ENTIRELY possible</span> to master the foundation and crystal healing in just a <span class="purple">matter of DAYS.</span> The art and science of it is far from complicated – in fact, it’s actually really simple…</p>
        
        <p>It takes a bit of studying at first, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll be able to <span class="purple">interpret crystals and stones at a single glance</span> – just like clockwork.</p>
        
        <p>BUT, we’ve taken that process and condensed it into a powerful material that can show you the ropes of crystal healing in an <span class="purple">even shorter amount of time.</span></p>
