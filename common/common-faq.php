<button class="accordion">What do I do about the materials from other similar programs?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The wonderful thing about all of our products is that each of them can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.</p>

<p>Individualogist's collection of materials seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.</p>
