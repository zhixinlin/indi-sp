        <p>The thing about understanding individuation is that there&rsquo;s so many bits and pieces that go into it. Think about it this way, each and every one of us is a <span class="purple">unique individual, with unique talents, unique dreams, and unique tendencies.</span></p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s so much more I have to tell you about your archetype! But I can&rsquo;t squeeze all of it into just one report. And that&rsquo;s where the Diminishing Your Shadow Reading comes in!</p>

        <p>Individuation was discovered and practiced by one of the famed founding fathers of psychology over a hundred years ago; Carl Jung. Nope, it was NOT developed by some random self-proclaimed psychological expert!</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with <span class="purple">psychology,</span> this probably isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;re hearing this name.</p>

        <p>In fact, individuation has been present since the days of the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, which means that the principles of individuation <span class="purple">traces back all the way to around 350BC.</span></p>

        <p>But why is this so important to know? Because I want you to know that <span class="purple">it works.</span></p>

        <p>Individuation develops a personality that&rsquo;s unique to each individual. It provides you with a much <span class="purple">deeper insight</span> into your personality traits. So deep, that it has the ability to <span class="purple">heal</span> people in both physical and spiritual manners.</p>

        <p>And true that healing process, <span class="purple">life-changing miracles</span> are performed. But I&rsquo;ll tell you more about that in just a second.</p>

        <h2 class="dys-sub-header">And It All Begins With You. Are You Ready For This?</h2>

        <p>If you have not achieved the life of your dreams because you haven&rsquo;t done what you needed to do, then you&rsquo;re definitely not going to experience the same <span class="purple">miraculous change</span> without any help.</p>

        <p>This is your opportunity to receive help. If you pass on this chance, you&rsquo;re going to be left in the same exact position as you were moments before. You&rsquo;re not going to move any closer to achieving the life of your dreams. And you know what?</p>

        <p>Life isn&rsquo;t going to wait up for you.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/dys-2.jpg">

        <p>Think about the people who are in your life right now.</p>

        <p>How many of them have achieved the life of their dreams?</p>

        <p>How many of them seem to have found abundance in love, health and wealth?</p>

        <p>How many of them look like they&rsquo;re making good progress?</p>

        <p>How many times have you heard them tell you about their plans for that awesome body, or building that business?</p>

        <p>Now, how many of them have actually taken any action?</p>

        <p>Let me tell you this. I DO NOT want you to be one of those people. I DO NOT want you to be shortchanged in life. And I&rsquo;m sure that you don&rsquo;t want to be like those people either.</p>

        <p>I want you to live the <span class="purple">life of your dreams.</span> The life that you envisioned. The life that allows you to achieve success in everything that you do. Can you see that for yourself? Can you imagine the happiness you would feel?</p>

        <p>There comes a time in everyone&rsquo;s life where they must make a defining choice. The choice to <span class="purple">let go of your pride</span> and admit that what you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t working, and that you need help.</p>

        <p>I too, have had to make that choice. And that&rsquo;s when my life truly began to change.</p>

        <h2 class="dys-sub-header">This is your chance to make that choice. To make that change in your life.</h2>

        <p>Life is short. Before you know it, the window that will change your life <span class="purple">will close,</span> just like the other opportunities you&rsquo;ve missed. How silly would that be?</p>

        <p>Every day, you only have two decisions to make. To <span class="purple">feed your shadow</span> and keep living the way you&rsquo;ve been living, or to control your shadow and <span class="purple">live the life of your dreams.</span></p>

        <p>How many more opportunities do you have to miss before you decide to take action?</p>

        <p>Life doesn&rsquo;t expect you to know every single step of the way. Life is far too deep for us to comprehend and understand every little thing about it. All it expects us to do is to take that <span class="purple">first step forward,</span> and trust that it will lead us to the life we&rsquo;ve always dreamed of. That&rsquo;s the lesson that I learned a long time ago. Before I decided to take action, I was left with nothing. But once I surrendered, life gave me everything that I desired.</p>

        <p>Take that first step forward right now.</p>

        <p>Do it. For <span class="purple">yourself.</span></p>

        <p>Say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Today!</p>
