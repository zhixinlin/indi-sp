    <div class="eote-reading">
        <p>Dear <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>,</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-1.jpg">
        
        <p>you know how powerful Individuation is. And I know how serious you are about <span class="goldenrod">embarking on this journey.</span></p>
        
        <p>You know what? Not everyone who took the Archetype quiz gets to see this page. In fact, only <span class="goldenrod">a handful of incredibly fortunate individuals</span> have been selected to be shown this offer.</p>

        <p>And you’re one of them, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you remember what I told you about your archetype earlier, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. And as I mentioned, I truly believe that there’s <span class="goldenrod">great potential in you.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your existence is beyond the imaginable.</p>

        <p>You are a <span class="goldenrod">real blessing</span> to those around you, and I absolutely believe that your friends and family will wholeheartedly agree with me on this.</p>

        <p>But I sense that there is something that stands in your way…</p>

        <p>There’s an obstacle separating the life that you have right now, and the life that you’ve always dreamed of…</p>
        
        <h2 class="eote-sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, That Obstacle is Yourself...</h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-2.png">
        
        <p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that you’re deliberately stopping yourself from achieving greatness!</p>

        <p>You are, however, subconsciously holding yourself back.</p>

        <p>What’s happening here is that <span class="goldenrod">your Ego is standing in the way of your Self.</span></p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your Ego is a <span class="goldenrod">self-constructed image</span> – a version of yourself that only you can see.</p>

        <p>Your Self, on the other hand, represents the <span class="goldenrod">true version</span> of who you are.</p>

        <p>It’s a part of your soul, and a part of your existence.</p>

        <p>As you can already tell, discerning between the two can be difficult at times, and that’s what’s going on.</p>
        
        <h2 class="eote-sub-header">Now, I want you to pay close attention, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-3.png">
        
        <p>…Because what I’m about to say next just might be the most important thing that you’ll ever have to hear.</p>

        <p>The blockage that your facing is a difficult problem to resolve, but it’s not impossible.</p>

        <p>In fact, with the right knowledge, the right tools, and the right mindset, overcoming this boulder will be so easy that you could have done it as a child!</p>

        <p>And guess what? >Everything that you need to <span class="goldenrod">regain control over your life</span> lies right here, on this page.</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <div class="point-glow">
            <p>You are the captain of your own ship.</p>
            <p>You are the master of your own soul.</p>
            <p>But it’s almost impossible to steer yourself in the right direction...</p>
            <p>…Not when your Ego’s fighting you for the driver’s seat.</p>
        </div>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-4.jpg">
        
        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I know how it feels to struggle. I struggled my entire life before I came across this. So…</p>
        
        <ul class="eote-bullet">
            <li>If you feel like you’re on the brink of burning out…</li>
            <li>If manifestation doesn’t seem to be working for you…</li>
            <li>If your numerology predictions don’t seem to be taking place…</li>
            <li>If you’re feeling as if the cosmos isn’t blessing you like the gurus said it would…</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Then this is EXACTLY what you need. This is <span class="goldenrod">EXACTLY</span> what’s going to <span class="goldenrod">COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONIZE</span> your entire life, and your entire being.</p>
        
        <h2 class="eote-sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I Want You To Picture A Door In Front Of You...</h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-5.jpg">
        
        <p>The door is ajar… it’s unlocked and it’s open.</p> 
        
        <p>And the <span class="goldenrod">life that you’ve always dreamed of</span> lies beyond that door…</p>

        <p>…Would you open it?</p> 

        <p>Of course you would!</p> 

        <p>And you know what? That’s exactly the situation that you are in right now.</p> 

        <p>The door has already been <span class="goldenrod">unlocked for you.</span> The door has already been opened for you.</p> 

        <p>All you need to do, is give it a little push. Yes, it’s that easy, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

            <p>..The Supreme Mastery Code: Eclipse Of The Ego</p>
            <p>features 8 complete modules of high quality content</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-cover.png">
        
        <p>The Supreme Mastery Code: Eclipse of the Ego is a mastery audio course that will teach you exactly what you need to do to <span class="goldenrod">identify your Ego</span>, and remove it from the equation.</p>

        <p>It gives you the step-by-step process that you need to return to your <span class="goldenrod">true Self,</span> and become the person that you were meant to be.</p>

        <p>That’s right, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. This is your moment to re-master your life.</p>

        <p>And all of it begins with how you <span class="goldenrod">respond to this message today.</span></p>
        
        <p>Here’s the truth, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. I personally believe in your gifts and the wonders of your archetype. That’s why I want to extend this exclusive course to you.</p>

        <p>I want to see you soar beyond the clouds and <span class="goldenrod">achieve greatness.</span></p>

        <p>But not everyone who sees this page will take action – that’s the truth. And yes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you guessed it…</p>

        <p>…The people that choose not to take action, are allowing their Egos to make the decision for them.</p>

        <p>They convince themselves that they’re able to do this on their own…</p>

        <p>They convince themselves that whatever they have right now is “good enough”…</p>

        <p>Some even convince themselves that they don’t even have this problem to begin with!</p>

        <p>You already know this, but that’s the Ego speaking on behalf on those people.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I don’t want you to fall into that trap. I truly do care about you. And it’s just as important to me as it is to you to see you <span class="goldenrod">live the life that you were meant to live.</span></p>
        
        <h2 class="eote-sub-header">The realm of individuation has several layers.</h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/eote-6.jpg">

        <p>Discovering your archetype is the first leg of the journey.</p>

        <p>Diminishing your Shadow is the second leg of the journey.</p>

        <p>What’s the final leg, you ask?</p>

        <p>It’s transcending your Ego to reach your true Self…</p>

        <p>…To finally become one with your soul…</p>

        <p>To finally release yourself from who you think you are, and transform into who you were meant to be.</p>
