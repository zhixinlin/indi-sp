        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your element is Air. And that makes you a <span class="purple">“thinker”</span>, rather than a “feeler” – quite the opposite of the Fire element.</p>

        <p>Your <span class="purple">rational and logical</span> approach to anything and everything makes you amongst the cleverest of the elements, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>It’s likely that you’re a <span class="purple">calm and pleasant</span> individual who prefers to keep to yourself and soak in and examine the environment that surrounds you, rather than become immersed in it.</p>

        <p>That’s because you can be a <span class="purple">little bit studious</span>, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… After all, knowledge is power, isn’t it? However, that does not mean to say that you’re boring. The Air element can be quite entertaining by its own right, and I believe that really translates into the way that you’re able to <span class="purple">paint colourful stories.</span></p>

        <p>Your <span class="purple">wit</span> is what really sets you apart in a crowded room, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You probably enjoy a <span class="purple">good pun</span> and you’re rather talented when it comes to <span class="purple">wordplay.</span> Fulfilment in your work life can most probably be found through <span class="purple">writing or communicating</span> of sorts. In fact, marketing or public relations just might be your forte.</p>

        <p>You pride yourself on your ability to <span class="purple">think through difficult predicaments,</span> and “feeling” things out is not in your vocabulary. In fact, it’s likely that you don’t even understand the concept of intuition. You’d very much rather <span class="purple">pay attention to the facts,</span> and make decisions based on sound calculations.</p>

        <p>That also makes you more of a “big picture” person, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… You prefer not to focus on minute details – instead, you shift your sights towards the <span class="purple">environment at large.</span> As such, you’d probably make an excellent philosopher or economist… Perhaps even a politician or a public relations representative for one.</p>

        <p>Unlike the other elements, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you’re not one for traditions. After all, traditions are illogical. Your personal and spiritual beliefs follow a similar pattern, one of <span class="purple">sense and logic.</span></p>

        <p>As an Air element, you’re an <span class="purple">excellent multi-tasker.</span> Just like the element itself, you’re able to fill up any spaces in yo<span class="purple">ur environment. That’s also evident in your vast knowledge of the world – one that’s fed by your <span class="purple">incessant curiosity.</span></p>

        <p>However, that also means that you’re often easily distracted. Your head is filled with wonderful ideas, but they just keep on coming. It’s important to see one thing through, than to see nothing to fruition, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… And that is a challenge that you’ll have to overcome on your own.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I like to think of the Air element as an <span class="purple">absent-minded genius…</span> Kind of like a crazed scientist. There is no doubt that you’re a brilliant individual, but your brilliance is sometimes <span class="purple">tainted with impractical expectations.</span></p>

        <p>Despite all of that, you have a certain charm when it comes to social situations… Although, you do have to <span class="purple">pay closer attention to your emotions.</span> Your obsession with knowledge and ideas might mean that you end up neglecting other aspects of your life, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. Especially with romance and relationships…</p>

        <p>However, as soon as you choose to focus on that part of your life, I have no doubt that you’ll be able to <span class="purple">find the perfect love</span> that you seek.</p>
