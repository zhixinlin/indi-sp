        <p>As an Earth person, you care about what is real, physical, and experiential.</p>
            
        <p>You’re someone who enjoys getting your hands dirty, especially since your element is an <span class="purple">experiential learner.</span></p>

        <p>Above all things, you’re ultimately <span class="purple">a realist</span> as opposed to a dreamer. The standards that you set for yourself are certainly high and admirable, but the goals that you set for yourself are always achievable.</p>

        <p>That’s because of your <span class="purple">innate patience, and methodical approach</span> when it comes to working towards your dreams.</p>

        <p>That being said, you resonate with others who are also realists, often dismissing wishy-washy individuals as a little bit ‘too much’ for you to handle. You’re also someone who finds attraction in the tangible.</p>

        <p>As an artist, you would gravitate towards sculpting as opposed to painting – that’s because you prefer to <span class="purple">feel things with your hands,</span> rather than use a medium, such as a paint brush or a pencil.</p>

        <p>You are a wholesome and homely individual, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. Based on your Earth instincts, you’d very much rather spend your day nuzzled in the comfort of your comfy couch and being fed your favourite snacks instead of being out and about.</p>

        <p>This also means that as an Earth element, you’re rather protective of your home – your nest… Your home is always a <span class="purple">touchstone</span> that you yearn to return to, and being “settled” is your favorite state.</p>

        <p>It’s likely that you’d very much prefer to live near the place where you grew up, as the Earth element’s sense of rootedness shines greatly within you.</p>

        <p>When it comes to commitment, you’re never afraid. The relationships that you forge with your friends, family, co-workers, and even lovers all tend to be <span class="purple">far more long-lasting</span> than usual. At the very least, that’s what you prefer.</p>

        <p>From the standpoint of your romantic life, as an Earth element, you’re marriage-minded and you’re governed by long-term prospects. There is no doubt that you are generally faithful, although you do struggle with the occasional temptation.</p>

        <p>After all, as an Earth element, you can be very physical – especially when it comes to the bedroom. You’re comfortable with your body and external appearance, and you’re certainly not shy when it comes to touching. It’s likely that your love language is best <span class="purple">expressed through physical touch,</span> and you enjoy little hugs and holding hands.</p>

        <p>However, as an Earth element, you have the tendency to be stubborn – especially when it comes to your personal beliefs. You find it difficult to <span class="purple">change your mind</span> when it comes to your ways, and that also makes it difficult for others to communicate with you. That’s a barrier that you have to work on, especially if you’ve set your sights on marriage or long-term business relationships.</p>
