        <span class="element-xl fire"></span>
        
        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your element is Fire. Deep within you lies a burning sense of desire – an unbreakable passion for your ideas, goals, and personal beliefs.</p>
            
        <p>Naturally, you’re a leader. Primarily because you’re able to <span class="purple">convey your thoughts</span> with a believable and genuine sense of <span class="purple">conviction.</span> It’s no wonder that others are so compelled to listen to whatever you have to say, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>You truly are a fascinating individual, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. The other elements are often in awe of your actions… Almost as if they were being <span class="purple">hypnotized by the elegance</span> of a burning flame.</p>

        <p>Unlike the other elements, the Fire element is one that truly excels with a partner belonging to the Air family. The craftiness of the Air element often gels well with the <span class="purple">perfect execution of the Fire</span> element. For every successful Fire element, there’s almost always an Air strategist right beside him.</p>

        <p>You’re someone who <span class="purple">listens to your own intuition</span> as opposed to sound logic – for better, or for worse. If you’re sure of something, it’s often difficult for you to explain why. That’s because you’re an individual who prefers to <span class="purple">act rather than analyse.</span> But there’s no doubt that youre unwavering trust in your innate instincts <span class="purple">always pays off</span> somehow.</p>

        <p>You’re fully <span class="purple">committed to your passions,</span> and that really translates into your <span class="purple">energy and aura.</span> Whenever you step into a room, everyone notices. As an individual filled with endless energy, you’re <span class="purple">interesting, exciting, and simply fun</span> to be around.</p>

        <p>That <span class="purple">burning passion and desire</span> also applies to your sexuality, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You’re playful, lustful, and passionate. You’re a <span class="purple">romantic at heart</span> – never shying away from grand romantic gestures, and you’re especially devoted to your significant other.</p>

        <p>However, that same passion and desire can be interpreted to be a bit of a double-edged sword. Your heated passion can quickly sour, especially when angered. Your temper is something that lacks control, and you have the <span class="purple">tendency to “explode”.</span></p>

        <p>You must also bear in mind that your <span class="purple">impulsiveness</span> can at times get the best of you, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>… It’s best to resist temptations by disciplining your heart and mind, and through that, you will avoid making grave mistakes.</p>

        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>d, as long as you remember to <span class="purple">strive for balance,</span> and continue to actively seek mastery and knowledge about yourself, you will be able to <span class="purple">overcome your weaknesses</span> to become the best leader, person, and lover that you were meant to be.</p>
