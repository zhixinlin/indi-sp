        <span class="element-xl water"></span>
        
        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as someone belonging to the Water element, you’re someone who <span class="purple">feels first and foremost.</span> You tend to be governed by your <span class="purple">emotions,</span> and you’re someone who’s extremely <span class="purple">empathetic.</span></p>
        
        <p>You possess a great facility with <span class="purple">feeling,</span> <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… You’re someone who’s <span class="purple">affectionate, compassionate, caring, </span>and I’m sure all of your friends and family will agree with me on this – you are an excellent listener. The greatest of all the elements, in fact.</p>

        <p>That being said, the Water element often makes a <span class="purple">talented therapist.</span> Perhaps it might be time to start billing your friends every time they come to you with a problem! You do, however, find yourself enjoying playing the role of the trusted confidant. It’s always exciting to be the <span class="purple">Keeper of Secrets,</span> isn’t it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>?</p>

        <p>You’re someone who’s <span class="purple">flexible,</span> and you like to go with the flow to see where things take you. But unlike the Air element, you’re <span class="purple">not as fluttery.</span></p>

        <p>Your <span class="purple">movements and intentions</span> often have a <span class="purple">definite path,</span> albeit an often unexpected one. You’re the one that <span class="purple">others tend to underestimate,</span> and that always puts you in an advantageous position. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, we both know that you’re <span class="purple">smarter</span> than you make yourself out to be… A LOT. Smarter. And perhaps a little sneakier as well.</p>

        <p>However, your sensitivity to your emotions disallows yourself from resorting to evil. That being said, you’re someone who has a <span class="purple">giving heart.</span> You’re generous with the resources that you have, and you’re always <span class="purple">ready to share</span> and spread goodness to others.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Water element, you’re not someone who struggles in social situations. In actuality, despite your <span class="purple">calm and composed appearance,</span> you’re someone who enjoys socializing… Although not all Water elements are “bubbly” and “smiley”.</p>

        <p>Above all, you are a dreamer, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You often fantasize about the what ifs and could have beens… But at the same time, you’re always doing your best to <span class="purple">live with no regrets.</span></p>

        <p>Water elements are often <span class="purple">artistic</span> as well, and are especially found among talented painters and musicians. That’s because the Water element moves and prances about with grace and sensuality – resemblant of the <span class="purple">fluidity and calmness</span> of water itself.</p>

        <p>However, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you can be a little bit <span class="purple">mysterious</span> to others. Although the Water element does its best to attract positivity into its life, you know that you also have the tendency to become a little dark.</p>

        <p>You’re not the talkative type, and other elements might interpret that to be <span class="purple">silent and brooding.</span> In order to curb that, you should surround yourself with other elements to create diversity in your life.</p>

        <p>You’re not the type to struggle with your love life, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… You’re someone who <span class="purple">gives and receives love</span> without limits. While other elements tend to be more conservative with the amount of love that they choose into invest into others, you never hold yourself back. You <span class="purple">love your hardest,</span> <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… But that also means that heartbreaks are excruciatingly more painful for you.</p>

        <p>Water elements tend to be more sexual than other elements, but your personal opinion about sex tends to deviate towards <span class="purple">emotional and spiritual love.</span> Physical acts of affection to you are more of a bonus – not a need. However, that sense can lead to its fair share of problems for the Water element, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>…</p>

        <p><span class="purple">Depression, sadness, and addiction</span> are the banes of the Water element. Negativity can quickly turn you irrational, and in rare cases, also slightly psychotic…</p>

        <p>You can be as inconsistent as the tides, changing their minds the way Earth elements change their socks. Surrounding yourself with other elements is what will keep you sane, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… After all, life is all about <span class="purple">creating balance</span> across all facets of life.</p>
