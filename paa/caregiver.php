        <p>Dear <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Caregiver! But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.</p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Caregiver, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Caregiver - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an individual who posseses great capacities of love... An individual whose sole purpose is to give large chunks of yourself to others.</p>

        <p>That being said, you truly are a unique individual, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... And needless to say, the world certainly needs more people like you.</p>

        <p>And despite your seemingly simple appearances, you're definitely a whole lot smarter than you make yourself out to be. In other words, because of your archetype, there's no doubt that you possess a profound level of intelligence...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/caregiver.png">

        <p>...A level of intelligence that is not merely limited to academics.</p>

        <p>But... Because of your humble and mild-mannered nature, you'd very much prefer to hide that specific trait about you.</p>

        <p>You'd very much rather be underestimated than overestimated, isn't that right, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>?</p>

        <p>You're also deeply sensitive when it comes to other's emotions - your emotional quotient amongst the highest in the archetypes... Allowing you to experience the pains, struggles, and happiness of others...</p>

        <p>Your selflessness comes unparalleled, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You're always so ready to give to others - whether its in the form of time through volunteering, in the form of money through donations, or even in the form of simple acts of love through listening to another's sorrows.</p>

        <p>And unlike others, you're not picky when it comes to who you choose to give to. It doesn't matter to you, does it? Whether it's giving to loved ones, acquaintances, and often times, even strangers.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But your generosity does not go unnoticed. In fact, it inspires and encourages literally every one around you.</p>

        <p>And that's why the world needs more people like you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Caregiver, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype has a magnetizing personality... One that draws respect and admiration from your <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>s and loved ones.</p>

        <p>It's no wonder that people are always looking towards you whenever they need a listening ear.</p>

        <p>And unlike other archetypes, you're not one to have massive circles of <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>s. But that does not mean to say that you have trouble with making <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>s, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p>In fact, it's quite the contrary. The other archetypes often find themselves drawn to your calm and tender presence.</p>

        <p>You are, however, a little bit selective when it comes to who you choose to let into your life.</p>

        <p>You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your circle of <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>s small.</p>

        <p>Amongst the people who know you best, you're often seen as a parental figure... Someone that they look to for guidance and advice.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, this gives rise to your natural inclination to teach others, as you draw energy from imparting knowledge to those around you.</p>

        <p>Caregivers often find the greatest amounts of fulfillment in careers that involve a lot of teaching and guiding, and nurturing.</p>

        <p>Despite your mild-mannered character, there's a fierceness that resides deep within you. A fierceness that's only revealed when you have to protect the people you care deeply about - especially your children.</p>

        <p>You're willing to give everything and anything it takes to keep them safe from harm.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Magnanimous Caregiver, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your strengths, resilience, and fortitude, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>You see, because of your sympathetic and giving nature, your actions are highly prone to being misunderstood - misinterpreted, even.</p>

        <p>At times, others might be cynical of your good intentions. At times, they might even tarnish your reputation by spreading false rumours about you.</p>

        <p>Bullies have their eye on you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - cowards who have to rely on throwing their weight around to make themselves feel strong.</p>

        <p>Don't let that discourage you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You are far stronger than they are, and in eventuality, you will be recognized for the altruistic and giving individual that you are.</p>

        <p>After all, you are the one who keeps the world grounded in sympathy and empathy, by spreading your kindness and joy to everyone around you.</p>

        <p>In the face of wicked hearts and selfishness, your heart of purity and kindness will prevail, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Caregiver, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you tend to concern yourself with acts of sharing. You’re always happy to share your knowledge, wisdom and experiences with those around you. That is where you derive fulfilment from. The more you share, the more you express care for others, the happier you seem to be.</p>

        <p>However, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, that can make you dependent on others for your own happiness. And that is something that you need to be careful of.</p>

        <p>At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others. That’s not what you want, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself. When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow. And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/caregiver-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. Love interests find themselves drawn to your nurturing and giving nature.

        <p>You’re fiercely loyal, patient, giving, and emotionally connected. The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.</p>

        <p>That being said, you tend to be very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.</p>

        <p>You can use this little guide to determine potential life partners - especially since they're the ones who are far more aligned to your personal journey than other archetypes.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
