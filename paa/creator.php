        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Creator, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Creator - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an individual who posseses a stupendous amount of creativity... An individual whose sole purpose is to express yourself through your idealistic and innovative mind.</p>

        <p>That being said, you truly are a unique individual, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... And needless to say, the world certainly needs more people like you.</p>

        <p>You're someone who's also incredibly resourceful, scrappy, and imaginative... Finding all sorts of ways to express your ideas and feelings. Because of this, you're also somoene who's well-respected by the others around you - for your talents and abilities in the things, hobbies, and skills that you're passionate about.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/creator.png">

        <p>...Your archetype also suggests that you're highly opinionated, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... You take great pride in your work - your craft. It's what you live for, and also what you're willing to sacrifice for.</p>

        <p>You hold high regards for your originality, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... It is highly representative of you to refuse to conform to societal expectations. You're often challenging the norm - battling against conventional rules.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that you're often on the lookout for opportunities to showcase your talents. After all, the admiration and respect that you receive can feel rather rewarding, doesn't it?</p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But you're gifted - at least, more so than the other archetypes. You pour your heart, mind, and soul into anything that you construct, ensuring that the outcomes resembles the closest thing possible to perfection.</p>

        <p>The Creator archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, is also one that seems to enjoy working with its hands. You prefer to immerse yourself in the tangible experience of what it means to create. The lesser the medium, the closer you feel to your work.</p>

        <p>And unlike others, you're not exactly the mostsociable person on the planet... On a bright Sunday afternoon, you'd very much prefer to remain in the comfort of your own home - honing your talents and improving yourself instead of being out shopping or spending time with your friends.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But your creativity is inspiring and encouraging to the people around you - mostly your peers. And because of this, your archetype truly has the capacity to achieve greatness.</p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... I have no doubt that you will one day uncover ground-breaking solutions, and contribute great things to the world.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Creator, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, although you tend to be rather aloof in the conversations that you share with others, you do also seem to enjoy the occasional chit-chat. That's because you've constructed thick barriers between you and the rest of the world - but unfortunately, it can get a little at times...</p>

        <p>That's why you're more than elated whenever someone comes to you for a listening ear.</p>

        <p>That's also explains your introspective tendencies - especially when you're on your own. It's not unusual for philosphical thoughts to cross your mind ever so often. You seem to draw energy from being by yourself, and expending energy when you're surrounded by others.</p>

        <p>Although, that does not hinder you one bit, doesn't it, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>? After all, you do possess the confidence to do things on your own, and you certainly have the composure and poise to pull it off.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p>Based on those attributes, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's evident that you'll experience the greatest amount of fulfillment and joy from pursuing a career as an artist, a designer, a writer, a creative director, or pretty much anything that taps into your out-of-the-box thinking.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you're also someone who's open-minded. You're very accepting of people who come from different backgrounds. You have the sense to realize that different perspectives exist, and you're always reminding yourself to be respectful of that.</p>

        <p>That's also because you tend to enjoy things that are a bit out of the ordinary and venturing out into the unknown - things that individuals belonging to other archetypes rarely think about.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - you have a rather quirky personality, and a diverse set of interests. But those are the little oddities that make you who you are, wouldn'y you agree?</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Inventive Creator, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your strengths, resilience, and fortitude, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, there are fears that reside within your archetype... Deep-seated fears that appear miniscule to others, but appear menacing to you.</p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of appearing unoriginal, or even mediocre. And this stems from one thing, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... It stems from the concern that you have of how others perceive you.</p>

        <p>Although you're always telling yourself not to care, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, there's a part of you that struggles to let go. And even though you manage to successfuly convince yourself some times, you eventually fall back into the same patterns and same routines.</p>

        <p>Don't let that discourage you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You possess a strong source of inner strength...  And your fears are certainly far more profound than the fears of others. Society has evolved into a platform of judgments - people judge, and are therefore afraid of being judged. And the sooner you recognize that, the sooner you'll be able to step out of that domain.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you must also be careful of your own perfectionism. That's the strange thing about your archetype - what you're good at can also be your worst enemy.</p>

        <p>After all, too much of a good thing is a bad thing, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>Your unhealthy obsession with perfectionism can stop you from even trying in the first place. And there is no greater failure than preventing yourself from failing.</p>

        <p>To maximize the abilities of your archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you must always be trying, always be experimenting, and always be failing. As ironic as it sounds, that is the journey that will lead you to your eventual success.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Creator, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are the epitome of expression – possessing the uncanny ability to communicate your emotions in the most creative, yet accurate ways. You excel at one-on-one interactions, and never fail to make an excellent impression on others. Your unique thinking and intelligence intrigues people.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an executor. You have a clear vision of what you want to achieve. And as soon as you've set your mind to it, you can consider it done.</p>

        <p>Your brilliant mind crafts and generates ideas at the speed of light, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, with each idea having more clarity, and more purpose than the last. That's your perceived path to fulfillment, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - seeing your ideas to fruition.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/creator-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you tend to be slightly neglectful as a lover - and I'm sure some of your exes or current partner will agree with me on this.</p>

        <p>That's because your mind is constantly scattered and spread out across an array of thoughts - and although you're physically present, your physical presence in presented with emotional absence.

        <p>However, that's just who you are, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. And any understanding, respectful lover will accept you for exactly the way that you are.</p>

        <p>Despite all of that, you're intensely committed to your partner - it's unlike you to have your heart stray, unless the circumstances of your relationship toe the lines of extemities.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you seem to be chirpier - more jovial, and more open. That's because trust is extremely important to you, because it's trust that will allow your archetype to open up.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
