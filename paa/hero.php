        <p>Dear <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Hero! But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.</p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Hero, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Hero - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype suggests that you're an individual who possess great mental strength, fortitude, and an unbreakable sense of perseverance. You are never fearful of what the future holds for you, and you're always willing to step up to challenges of any sort.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... The Hero archetype is best represented through the essence of sacrifice. Whether it's putting the needs of others in front of your own, or simply taking the initiative to serve the greater good, you're always in the front of the line.</p>

        <p>That specific trait about you stems from your deep-seated instincts, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... Instincts that forbid you from retreating in the face of adversity. Instincts that prevent you from laying still in the face of injustice.</p>

        <p>While others prefer to sit on the sidelines, that's just not in your interests. That is also why it is often said, that the Hero has no fears... But let's address that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/hero.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that there is a side of you that's relentless... Relentless in the sense of striving to improve yourself - whether it's your physical abilities, your mental fortitude, or your emotional resilience. That being said, you're certainly an individual of impressive characteristics - characteristics that are unique to your archetype.</p>

        <p>You seem to exercise selflessness in everything that you do, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... No matter how small or miniscule your actions appear to be, every decision that you make, no matter how small, is always for a purpose that serves others. And when it comes to making important and difficult decisions, you're assertive, firm, and steadfast.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that you're an individual of great empathy, and a strong sense of justice. You're intolerant when you encounter unfairness or corruption of any sort, and there's burning desire that drives you to want to do all forms of prejudice.

        <p>Your instinctive sense of righteousness is constantly pushing you to be better, to do more, and to try harder...

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But from time to time, you do get worn out. After all, being a hero is certainly not a task for the weak and feeble. It can be emotionally and physically draining most of the time. As difficult or as impossible as it sounds, you must learn to prioritize your own rejuvenation, <span aweber=field="name">Friend.

        <p>The Hero archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, is also one that strives for greatness. You have a strong vision of what you want to achieve in your lifetime - a vision that few will comprehend, but many will appreciate... Your compassion for your fellow man is what ultimately gives you the desire to change the world.</p>

        <p>You're an individual of great principles, character, and morals. Unlike the archetypes who tend to struggle with temptations and might struggle differentiating between right and wrong, you always have a clear idea of what is virtuous.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But your willingness to step up to the plate is inspiring and encouraging to the people around you - strangers, friends, and loved ones. And because of this, your archetype truly has the capacity to achieve greatness.</p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... I have no doubt that you will one day make a lasting impact on humanity, and contribute great things to the world.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Hero, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an individual who is incredibly grounded. You possess the unique ability to discern right from wrong, and you’re never afraid to put your foot down. You have a great deal to offer to this world. <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you have a number of leadership qualities... Especially since you're someone who's self-aware, decisive, and somewhat stern. People find themselves calmed by your presence, knowing that they have someone reliable and dependable by their side.</p>

        <p>But that's not all there is to the Hero archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... This is merely the beginning. As a Hero, you are  extremely protective of your loved ones. You're not the most expressive person on the planet, but each of your loved ones holds a special place in your heart. You might a little bit too protective at times, but it definitely comes from a good place.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... You're a lot more domestic than the other archetypes. Your home is your place of rest - a peaceful haven that you retire to at the end of each day - and also, a place where you're deeply emotionally attached to. And that stems from your sense of loyalty.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, there is no doubt that you're an individual who makes a protective partner, a caring parent, and a trustworthy friend.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's become abundantly clear that you'll experience the greatest amount of fulfillment and joy from pursuing a career that will allow you to make difficult decisions, and give you a strong sense of duty...</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you tend to perceive circumstances as either  black or white, with no gray in between. That particular trait might not sound all that positive, but it's one of the greatest factors that makes you such an effective decision maker.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around friends and family, you tend to adopt a more serious, no nonsense type of front. If a conversation does not produce value, then you'd rather not engage in it. You're not the type of person to clown around - you'd very much prefer to invest your time and energy into productive tasks instead of looking like a fool.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - you have a rather intense aura. That does not mean to say that it's a bad thing - after all, when it comes to getting things done, you'll always be on the top of everyone's lists, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>And yet, all is fair in the realm of Archetypes - where weaknesses can at times be strengths, and likewise, strengths too can quickly turn into weaknesses. And that applies to your archetype of the Hero as well, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Courageous Hero, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your strengths, resilience, and fortitude, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, despite your brave frontier, there are fears that reside within your archetype... Deep-seated fears that appear miniscule to others, but appear menacing to you.</p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of having others perceive you incorrectly, or even misjudged. Your archetype tends to concern itself with its image... Constantly wondering about what others think of you, whether or not they take a liking to you...

        <p>An unhealthy obsession that prevents you from embarking on something new, or trying something that you've never tried before. You're usually fearful of becoming the object of ridicule or laughter... That stems from your fear that the strong, dependable impression that you've worked so hard to portray will crumble.</p>

        <p>Deep inside your archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, beneath the bravado and seriousness, is a small part of you that just wants to be accepted and loved.</p>

        <p>Perhaps that might be why you concern yourself so much with appearances, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... Because without appearances, you're afraid that you'll lose your self-construed identity. That is perhaps, the greatest challenge that you must overcome, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></p>

        <p>As a Hero, you have the tendency to be a little too critical about yourself - constantly pushing yourself to achieve new heights, gain new experiences, and explore everywhere that you've never been before. But, at the same time, you must understand that growth takes time. You might not have all the time in the world, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, but it is paramount for you to exercise patience in order not to wear yourself out.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, advancement and growth are products of both time and effort, and when you implement that to become a part of your life, your passage to fulfillment will be revealed to you... All in due time.</p>

        <p>There's something else you need to be aware of, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>Although you tend to project yourself as someone serious, assertive, and seemingly hard to work with, you're an excellent team player - perhaps amongst the best of all the archetypes. You're both reliable and trusting, and that balance translates into the way you work with others. You're willing to be diligent and to step up to the tasks that you'r not familiar with, and you always find a solution.</p>

        <p>After all, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, this is the Hero's motto... When there's a will, there's a way. And that saying really shines through your actions and behaviour, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Hero, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, ultimately, you are a realist – someone who sets and achieves realistic goals. You're not comfortable with being wishy-washy or fickle-minded. When you've set your mind to something, you'll do everything it takes to make it happen.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, it's apparent that you have a strong sense of ambition - a sense of hunger to do greater things.</p>

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your struggle with your identity tends to hold you back... Your fear of looking silly - a fear that prevents you from trying different things. <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you will have to keep pushing your limits before you eventually discover your life’s purpose and direction. And that is something that you need to work towards with your archetype.</p>

        <p>And that's where your calling resides, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You want to live life for yourself, without limits. You want to be recognized and respected for who you are, while learning to be more bold with your impression.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/hero-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Hero archetype is a giving, faithful, and dependable lover. The ideal, dream-like partner who appears to be textbook-perfect.</p>

        <p>It's difficult to describe, but this is the most apt way of putting it. Based on the nature of your archetype, you tend to be an excellent life partner, but you tend to struggle with recognizing the right partners for you.</p>

        <p>It might take a while before you find the right one, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - but as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait. If you're not in a committed relationship, your best bet will be to exercise patience and caution during your search for a romantic partner.</p>

        <p>And in due time, you will meet the right one. However, don't be disheartened. Whether or not you're already in a committed relationship, you'll be just fine.</p>

        <p>And when, or if you already have, met the right one, you must be weary of temptations - committing yourself completely can be scary and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will overcome that fear and produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, depending on your level of comfort, you tend to be slightly more reserved than usual... Perhaps that stems from your struggle with how others perceive you - especially your romantic interest. However, as cliche as it sounds, you must remember that it's important to be yourself, and when you do, you will also be accepted for who you are.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
