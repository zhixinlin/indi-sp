        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Innocent, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Innocent - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, before you dismiss this Archetypal Introduction as nothing but hogwash, you must know that the Innocent archetype is NOT one that's typically associated with naivety. Truth be told, it is anything but. If you'd like to find out the truth about what the Innocent really resembles, then please proceed with the rest of this Archetypal Introduction with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...  The Innocent archetype is best defined by its sheer positivity, enthusiasim, and optimism. They're able to interpret any situation in a perspective that's hopeful, encouraging, and infectious. If you're thinking that there's a lot more to the Innocent archetype than just that, you're exactly right, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>!</p>

        <p>Individuals of the Innocent archetype, including you, tend to see the silver lining in every cloud and are constantly reminding themselves that there's virtue and a sense of goodness in everything, and every situation. You're always on the lookout for wisdom and lessons worth learning, no matter how painful your experiences get...</p>

        <p>To you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, everyone has a story worth listening to, every circumstance holds something worth experiencing, and everything that happens in life,  happens for a reason. That is a belief; a deep-rooted outlook that makes the Innocent archetype so remarkable.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/innocent.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that there is a side of you that's relentless... Relentless in the sense of striving to improve yourself - whether it's your physical abilities, your mental fortitude, or your emotional resilience. That being said, you're certainly an individual of impressive characteristics - characteristics that are unique to your archetype.</p>

        <p>You seem to exercise selflessness in everything that you do, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... No matter how small or miniscule your actions appear to be, every decision that you make, no matter how small, is always for a purpose that serves others. And when it comes to making important and difficult decisions, you're assertive, firm, and steadfast.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that you're simple, easy-going, and transparent. You're the type of person who's willing to wear your heart on your sleeve, stand up for your beliefs, and face the consequences of mistakes... An upstanding individual who's fearless in profound ways.

        <p>Amongst all the archetypes, you tend to have the purest of intentions... And that's best illustrated through the way you interact with others. Unlike others, when you claim to be happy for someone else, you actually do mean it from the bottom of your heart - and that goes a long way in forging valuable, close relationships.</p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But when things don't turn out your way, you're easily dispappointed. That, of course, does not mean to say that your spoilt... It's that your positive outlook on everything can sometimes set you up for disappointments. But that's the price you have to pay for possessing such a unique set of strengths, <span aweber=field="name">Friend.

        <p>The Innocent archetype is such a joy to be around, and I have no doubt that your friends and loved ones will agree with this. Your  light-hearted and jovial nature make you fun-loving, charismatic, and likeable. You try not to be seriuos most of the time, and you enjoy engaging in little things that will make someone else's day brighter. Whether it's pretending to laugh at a corny joke, applauding a predictable magic trick, you'd very much rather bless that person with positivty than put them down.</p>

        <p>And that's just a small piece of the puzzle that forms the entirety of the wonderful, angelic individual that you are. Unlike the archetypes who tend to struggle with hatred and anomisoty, you'd very much rather make friends than enemies. You're accepting, kind, and incredibly thoughtful.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But all of these personality traits lead to so much more. Your optimism makes you ferocious - like an unstoppable force. There is no archetype that matches your level of determination, because there is nothing stronger than  an unbreakable spirit.</p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... I have no doubt that you will one day infect others with your positivity, and influence them to have the same tenacity as you.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As An Innocent, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an individual who's capable of finding joy in the smallest of things. Your perspective of the world is through that of a childlike lens - and you experience life at the purest level. <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are most likely the motivator of any social group or work setting. You always seem to know the right words to say, and at the right time. You have the unique talent of calming others with your presence, knowing that they have someone who's rooting for them by their side.</p>

        <p>But that's not all there is to the Innocent archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... This is merely the beginning. As an Innocent, you are selfless - often putting your needs behind the needs of others. You put your best in everything that you do, and you always make sure that your heart's in the right place.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... You're far more magnanimous than others - always ready to  give more than you're willing to receive. And that stems from your willingness to see the goodness in people. In your eyes, all man is deserving of kindness - and that really translates through your actions.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, there is no doubt that you're an individual who makes a forgiving partner, a nurturing parent, and a dependable friend.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's become abundantly clear that you'll experience the greatest amount of fulfillment and joy from pursuing a career that will allow you to motivate and bring out the best in others... A noble duty that grows in greater demand as society becomes more detached and emotionally disconnectd.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you have a profound understanding of the innerworkings of the human soul. Your empathtic nature allows you to comprehend what someone else is going through, and you always seem to know how to lead them out of darkness. In many ways, you're the beacon of hope that has and will touch the lives of many.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you're always ready to offer a listening ear. You're always swift to listen, but slow to speak. If you've ever wondered why people are always sharing their deepest troubles with you, that is the exact reason why, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - you exude an aura of purity. You trust others just as easily as others are able to place their trust in you. That's because your earnestness really shows through your personality.

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Virtuous Innocent, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your strengths, resilience, and fortitude, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>The Innocent archetype tends to struggle with coming out of its comfort zone. It's likely that you prefer to stay within the constrains of what you deem to be familiar. You must know, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, with your strengths and unique talents, you are definitely capable of more than you could ever imagine.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as an Innocent, it is vital for you to take up the challenge of stepping out of your comfort zone. Being surrounded with unfamiliarity will allow room for you, as an Innocent, to develop and improve yourself. It does not have to toe the lines of extremeities, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - just small, little, progressive steps.</p>

        <p>Based on the telligs of your archetype, you need to learn to take these calculated risks, whether its in social interactions or at work. </p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of consequences, even though you have the capacity to power through anything that life throws at you, residing in your comfort zone for too long has made you fearful... Mistakes are part and parcel of life, and a life lived without mistakes does not equate to a fulfilled life.</p>

        <p>Understandably, it can be difficult for the Innocent to grow used to experiencing the pain of failure. And that fear in itself leads to a multitude of other challenges...</p>

        <p>You might tend to hold yourself back from seizing new opportunities, embarking on new ventures, or exploring unknown horizons... Things that could open doorways for you and reward you with new discoveries.</p>

        <p>Perhaps that might be why you concern yourself so much with the familiar, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... Because beyond the familiar, you're afraid that you'll lose your self-construed identity. That is perhaps, the greatest challenge that you must overcome, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></p>

        <p>You should be constantly jumping into new opportunities and discovering your path as it unfolds. That way, you’ll be able to continue to grow as a person, as an individual, and as an Innocent.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, advancement and growth are not gifts that are bestowed upon you - they are the fruits of hardwork and labour. And when you take action for your personal growth, your passage to fulfillment will be revealed to you... All in due time.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As An Innocent, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are on a quest – a quest for happiness; for joy. And as forementioned, your archetype tends to struggle with finding fulfilment... But with this Archetypal Introduction, there is no doubt that the end of the tunnel is fast approaching, and you will uncover your path to fulfillment a lot sooner than expected.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, your sheer positivity and inner fortitude will form the foundation of your success - whether it's in your career, your love life, or your personal goals. And as long as you continue to act on new opportunities of personal growth, you will find the success that you’re looking for.</p>

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your struggle with your fears tends to hold you back... Your fear of discomfort - a fear that prevents you from trying different things. <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you will have to keep pushing your limits before you eventually discover your life’s purpose and direction. And that is something that you need to work towards with your archetype.</p>

        <p>And that's where your calling resides, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You want to live life for yourself, a life of abundance and joy.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/innocent-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Innocent archetype is known to be sweet, kind, and accepting in a relationship... It's unlikely that you will encounter much difficulty with finding potential suitors.</p>

        <p>But, in this instance, it is important for you to be a little bit stringent with your criteria for a  potential romantic partner. After all, you have so much to offer as a lover - and you do tend to be a little bit careless with who you place your trust in. This piece of advice serves to save you another broken heart.</p>

        <p>It might take a while before you find the right one, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - but as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait. If you're not in a committed relationship, your best bet will be to exercise patience and caution during your search for a romantic partner.</p>

        <p>And in due time, you will meet the right one. However, don't be disheartened. Whether or not you're already in a committed relationship, you'll be just fine.</p>

        <p>And when, or if you already have, met the right one, you must be weary of temptations - committing yourself completely can be scary and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will overcome that fear and produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you're not afraid of embracing who you are and expressing what you feel. Perhaps that stems from your honesty and willingness to trust others - especially your other half. That is a reliable indicator of a love life that is healthy, easy-going, and nurturing.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
