        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Jester, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Jester - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, before you dismiss this Archetypal Introduction as nothing but hogwash, you must know that the Jester archetype is NOT one that's solely represented as a mere joker. Truth be told, there's so much more about the Jester archetype. As we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, The Jester archetype is blessed with astute, sharp, and quick-witted. That means that you are an individual who is able to approach a varierty of topics from a myriad of perspectives. Despite your playful appearance and mischievious behaviour, you are nimble and brilliant in your own unique way.

        <p>You seem to be able to breeze your way through life, with your unconventional ideas, amusing comments, and hilarious interpretations. Naturally, you're often the life of the party. People enjoy being around you, because wherever you go, good times are bound to follow!</p>

        <p>Others might perceive you to be an individual who's more emotional because of your spontaneity... But, you are in fact, more intuitive and perceptive than you make yourself out to be. After all, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your excellent sense of humour is constructed with creativity, and seasoned with your charisma. And that requires a certain calibre of incisiveness.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/jester.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that you're a charismatic individual... There's just something about the way you speak, the way you portray yourself, that appears hypnotic... Alluring, even.</p>

        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your ability to spice up your conversations. And all of that just seems to come naturally to you, doesn't it, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>? Your personable body language and outgoing attitude towards in life makes you a sheer joy to be around.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your archetype also suggests that you're casual, easy-going, and free-spirited. You're the type of person who allows your imagination to run wild, conjuring the most ridiculous ideas and painting the silliest images in your head... An individual who simply doesn't take life too seriously.

        <p>Amongst all the archetypes, yours is one of the few that's idealistic... And that's best illustrated through the innerworkings of your unique mind and vibrant personality. You tend to daydream more than you actually do, but whenever you do see your ideas to fruition, great things always seem to happen.</p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But you tend to waiver a bit when it comes to serious situations or harsh conversations. You'd very much rather avoid such instances entirely, instead of having to actually deal with them. That is a struggle that you must be careful of, <span aweber=field="name">Friend. But we'll speak more to that later.</p>

        <p>The Jester archetype is such a joy to be around, and I have no doubt that your friends and loved ones will agree with this. Your  light-hearted and jovial nature make you fun-loving, charismatic, and likeable. You try not to be seriuos most of the time, and you enjoy engaging in little things that make someone else's day brighter. Whether it's dropping one of your iconic one-liners or performing silly actions.

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Jester, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an individual who's impressionable, cheerful, and intriguing. You seem to be able to blend into any social group, and you have a wide circle of friends. People who cross paths with you have no trouble recognizing and remembering you. You're always able to bring smiles to the darkest of times, and your presence lights up the room.</p>

        <p>Your archetype also suggests that you're not the jealous or protective type - whether it's in relationships, friendships, or even as a parent. You hardly allow the actions of others to dampen your mood, and you prefer to be in complete control of your own emotions.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... Nothing pleases you more than experiencing the joys and emotions of life at its maximum. In tha face of adversity, you're somehow able to move past setbacks quickly, and effortlessly.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, nothing seems to be able to put you down - or not for long, to say the least.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Jester, you center your life around one thing - living in the present. You live life according to your own rules, and that states that the past shall be forgotten, and the future shall hold no worries... An outlook on life that allows you to retain your high spirits.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you have a profound understanding of what makes others tick. In a crowded room, you're constantly tapping into your analytical ability to dissect that crowd that surrounds you...</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you tend to take things rather lightly - you avoid bringing up serious topics and you make it an effort to keep things casual. It seems that you're not someone that others would come to to pour their frustrations and share their troubles, and you'd certainly like to keep it that way.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your aura is one that's bright, and radiant. Your laughter is infectious, and you're simply the person that everyone wants to be around.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Notorious Jester, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your strengths and personality traits, , you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>The Jester archetype tends to struggle with being serious. That is, of course, just part of who you are - as an archetype, and as an individual. However, you must know, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, that attribute about you also shapes the way that others perceive you, especially the people close to you.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Jester, it is vital for you to get in touch with your more serious side. That will be quintessential to your development as an all-rounded, balanced, and emotionally connected individual. This is the first step towards learning to open yourself up to others, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, and in that process, you will learn to trust as well as earn the trust of others.</p>

        <p>Taking things a little more seriously once in a while will show people that there's a different side to you; a side that they'll appreciate since it isn't displayed often. </p>

        <p>At first, it might seem as if you're losing your sense of identity. But that could not be further from the truth. In fact, working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your identity that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p>Based on your other traits, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you also seem to struggle with spending your time wisely. You're constantly procrastinating and putting things off until the very last minute.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it stems from your disinterest towards anything mundane. Nevertheless, learning to prioritize your time will be your first step towards achieving more - more than you could possibly imagine.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Jester, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, enthusiastic and humorous being. Like a fairy godmother with the touch of your wand, you’re able to spark laughter and smiles from all sorts of people.</p>

        <p>However, associating yourself too much with that one single aspect can make you lost sight of who you truly are. There is so much more to the Jester archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - and that includes your intellect and perception.</p> Your route to fulfillment can be found from the relationships that you forge with others. Whether it's in terms of your career, or even your love life.

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your struggle with your fears tends to hold you back... Your fear of seriousness is also indicative of your fear of disappointment. <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you have a profound understanding of the logic behind expectations, and fundamentally, your innermost thoughts are often pessimistic... Simply because you refuse to set yourself up for disappointments.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, there is power in positivity. There is great things to be learned from optimism - it's a form of energy in itself that has the potential to grant you fortitude and resilience... To weather out your potential challenges and difficulties. Embracing that will form a significant part of your calling in life.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/jester-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Jester archetype is known to be sensible, joyful, and fun in a relationship... You can, however, be a little bit indecisive at times.</p>

        <p>Finding potential partners isn't exactly difficult for you... But your biggest romantic challenge lies in maintaining and building a long-lasting relationship. After all, you do tend to seem emotionally absent and be a little bit distant, and that makes it hard to communicate with you at a deeper level.</p>

        <p>That lack of a connection is usually what does it in for you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. But as long as you're willing to and continue to work on that, there is no doubt that a rewarding romantic life will be waiting right around the corner for you - perhaps in the form of your current partner, or a potential suitor.</p>

        <p>However, if you already have met the right one, you must be weary of temptations - committing yourself completely can be scary and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will overcome that fear and produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you're not afraid of embracing who you are and expressing your true, playful self. As forementioned though, that is merely one aspect of your identity. It would not be possible to paint an entire picture with a single brush. Remember to embrace the different parts of yourself, and never be afraid to reveal them to your partner.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
