        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Magician, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Magician - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Magician archetype is one that has forged deep connections with the universe... Amongst all the archetypes, the Magician is perhaps the most difficult to comprehend, and you're well aware of that. You have a strong, unbreakable belief in your dreams, abilities, and yourself.</p>

        <p>Truth be told, the Magician archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, The Magician archetype is one of profound knowledge and intellect. You excel when it comes to deciphering patterns, breaking codes, and resolving problems. Your analytical ability and logical approach to everything makes you a reliable and efficient problem solver.</p>

        <p>That, however, also means that you have tendency to be rather distant, even though you're able to recognize the most intricate details about people. You instinctively know who to trust, and who to look out for. Others might label you as judgmental or perhaps a little too critical, but your deductions are often, or almost alawys right.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your fearlessness and ferocity when it comes to the ideas and beliefs that you're passionate about. It’s no wonder that the people you encounter are left with a strong impression.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/magician.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, there is a strong sense of discipline within you. Unlike other archetypes, you're not afraid of hardwork, and you're not afraid of suffering. Rather, you thrive on it.</p>

        <p>You have a strange appreciation for pain, but not in the same way as a masochist. Your appreciation for pain stems from associating it with growth and advancement - an appreciation that pushes you forward.</p>

        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your ability to engage in deep, thoughtful conversations. The bonds that you forge with others is often something they've never experienced before.</p>

        <p>Your deep understanding of feelings and approachable appearance makes you a warm and comforting presence to be around.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, this puts you at a great advantage when it comes to achieving the things that you set your mind to. You're the type of person who reaches for the stars, and you have no intention of falling amongst the clouds.</p>

        <p>Amongst all the archetypes, the Magician is the most cunning and crafty... You're able to influence the decisions of others without them knowing. Your methodical when it comes to planning your steps, and you always seem to be one step ahead.</p>

        <p>You tend to make an excellent listener, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But that trait of yours comes from knowing that information is power. You're slow to reveal your innermost thoughts... You're a firm believer of revealing just enough, but absorbing more than you need.</p>

        <p>The Magician archetype is one that also has the tendency to become manipulative and scheming. For the most part, you do exercise compassion and your heart's often in the right place. But it's also important to learn to be forgiving and patience, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Magician, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are intuitive, knowledgable, and versatile. You have a wide variety of interests, but perhaps your greatest interest of all is learning.</p>

        <p>But the learning in question does not refer to academics - not even close. Whether its finding out how certain things are made, or understanding why certain people are charismatic, you're just simply interested to know everything. That's all driven by your perpetual curiosity, and your talent in comprehending concepts quickly.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...You're also incredibly versatile. You're able to assume different roles according to different situations - very much like an actual magician, who has numerous tricks hidden in his sleeves.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is within a team setting - you're able to fill up whatever role is left, and you're able to do it well.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, you're an individual who's highly observant, and incredibly resourceful.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Magician, you're actually a lot more nurturing than you think. You might appear to be a little bit emotionally detached on the outside, but when you're alone, you're actually someone who's warm, caring, and tender.</p>

        <p>And that translates into how well you're able to connect with others - an indicator of emotional stability.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's likely that others often come to you for guidance and advice... That's because as a Magician, you're meticulous when it comes to examining the details of any given situation... Allowing you to determine underlying causes that are unbeknownst to others.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you tend to be a little bit more reserved, especially in larger groups. But, you excel impressively in when it comes to one-on-one interactions. That's where you feel the most comfortable, knowing that your voice can be heard, and you can forge a deeper, more personal connection.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, while you do enjoy using your talents to help others, you grow irritable when they refuse to listen. You must always remember not to allow the choices of others to affect your state.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Magnificent Magician, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your Archetypal strengths and personality traits, , you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>The Magician archetype tends to struggle with its pride and expectations of others. And that often drives you to be dismissive, critical, and overly serious.</p>

        <p>But that's also indicative of a deeper fear that resides within you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... The fear of failing others... And failing yourself</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Magician, your expectations are often set far too high. At times, your optimistic standards can be an excellent attribute - pushing you to greater heights...</p>

        <p>But that's not always the case. There are instances where you, or others, might fall short - and that's when you tend to experience frustration, disappointment, and helplessness.</p>

        <p>You must understand that life has so much more to offer, and people are not determined by their ability to meet your expectations - much less yourself. It will be impossible to avoid such setbacks entirely, but how you handle these upsets will determine the <span ckass="purple">destination of your journey.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a Magician. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the wonders and greatness that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of weaknesses and challenges. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Magician, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, While others seem to find it difficult to even understand the fundamentals of a new skill, you’re able to attain mastery over anything you set your mind to. In a way, your greatest strength is your ability to learn.</p>

        <p>You have a insatiable thirst for knowledge - constantly sourcing for new skills and learning opportunities to add to your already impressive arsenal of competencies.</p>

        <p>With those attributes in mind, you will certainly find fulfillment and enjoyment when you engage yourself in a career that allows you to assume a variety of roles... A position that forces you to apply yourself and your different talents.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you have the capacity to perform great feats in your lifetime. But you must remember that you cannot do everything on your own - and that's where forging valuable connections with others will come into play.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/magician-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Magician archetype is known to be faithful, tender, and devoted in a relationship... You're giving and understanding - attributes than any lover would cherish.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as much as you dislike to admit it, there is a strong yearning for romance that resides within you. And that's supported by your faithfulness and committment in a relationship.</p>

        <p>However, when you're focused too much on your relationship, you tend to become manipulative of your partner - often trying to influence him or her to change his or her perspective and beliefs. It's not that mean you to, it's just simply habitual - a part of your subconscious.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you can be a little bit distant when your mind's distracted - and no matter how you try to hide it, people will always notice that about you. In order to forge stronger relations with your partner, you must learn to be both physically and emotionally present.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
