        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Member, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Member - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Member archetype is one of the most interesting and contributing archetypes in society... Essentially, the Members are the ones who form the building blocks of the world... The ones who subscribe and participate in great causes.</p>

        <p>As a Member, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are charismatic, empathetic, and principled.</p>

        <p>Truth be told, the Member archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, The Member archetype is one with that's exorbitantly talented in connecting and networking with others. You excel when it comes to making others feel comfortable, and creating links between people.</p>

        <p>You're able to motivate, drive, and inspire others to succeed. You instinctively know the right words to say, and you're able to somehow blend into different social groups, and social circles.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your passion for people. Whether it's your friends, co-workers, loved ones, or more often than not, even strangers.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/member.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Member, you're able to earn the trust of others with your transparency. Unlike other archetypes, you're not afraid to bare it all and prove to others that your intentions are genuine.</p>

        <p>That seems to spring from your deep sensitivity to the emotions of others... A sensitivity that allows you to notice when someone feels shy, fearful, depressed - no matter how hard they try to hide it.</p>

        <p>It's a talent that cannot be explained by logic - but the best way to describe it, is that you have a 'feeling' for feelings.</p>

        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your ability to engage in deep, thoughtful conversations. The bonds that you forge with others is one that's based on trust, understanding, and and sincerity.</p>

        <p>Your deep understanding of feelings and approachable appearance makes you a warm and comforting presence to be around.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, this puts you at a great advantage when it comes to meeting and building relationships with people who can help you grow.</p>

        <p>As a Member, you thrive on interacting with the world - taking notice of everything that it has to offer... Its nature, its people, and its cultures.</p>

        <p>You offer balanced perspectives, always remembering that there's two sides to a story. That theme of harmony flows into your choice of words, and the the decisions that you make.</p>

        <p>You tend to make an excellent listener, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... You offer valuable input about tricky situations and disputes between others. That trait is emanated by your principled stance, morals, and ethics.</p>

        <p>The Member archetype has a profound connection to the world. You're kind and considerate towards others' differences...</p>

        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Member, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are trustworthy, accepting, and conscientious.</p>

        <p>It's likely that you have a great number of friends - friends that you know you can trust and depend on. That's because your sincerity is almost always reciprocated.</p>

        <p>After all, kindness is a debt that can only  be paid forward - and in one way or another, it's always returned to its rightful benefactor.</p>

        <p>You do however, prefer to keep your circle of friends on the smaller side, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... Perhaps there's only a select number of people that you choose to spend most of your time with.

        <p>That's because of you tend to be more careful about who you let into your life - knowing that soured relationships can really dampen your mood.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, you're also an individual who's altruistic and charitable. You rarely shy away from opportunities to give - as long as you know that whatever you do is for a good cause...</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, you're best represented by your selflessness, your open-mindedness, and your charisma.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Member, you're realistic and modest when it comes to your goals. You prefer to take small steps, rather than large leaps - a more conservative approach that's both sound and sensible.</p>

        <p>And that translates into how well you're able to connect with others - an indicator of your high emotional quotient.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's likely that others often come to you for direction and encouragement...</p>

        <p>The Member archetype is uncanny when it comes to deciphering life lessons from sticky situations - translating them into golden nuggets of wisdom.

        <p>The words that you speak are often galvanizing, and that stems from your tactfulness.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you prefer not to be the centre of attention, especially when it comes to larger groups. The Member archetype is not one that shies away, but one that prefers to listen, observe, and absorb its environment.</p>

        <p>Your archetype truly shows when it comes to interacting with smaller groups, knowing that your voice is not drowned out by unnecessary noise.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, there are traits of profound leadership that are hidden within you - hidden because they have yet to be fully explored and cultivated. You're able to rally support, and compel people to believe in your cause.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Magnanimous Member, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your Archetypal strengths and personality traits, , you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>The Member archetype tends to struggle with its concerns of being in the limelight And that often drives you to be less out-spoken and slightly more timid.</p>

        <p>But that's also indicative of a deeper fear that resides within you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... The fear of rejection.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Member, you've grown used to listening to other people's problems that you become a bit more reserved when it comes to talking about your own.</p>

        <p>Perhaps there's a part of you that feels that it's burdensome to others, and you'd rather bear it all on your own.</p>

        <p>But that could not be further from the truth, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. People are almost always interested to know more about you, and that includes your frustrations, disappointments, and troubles.</p>

        <p>You must forego the limiting belief thatlistening is all it takes, and be more open about sharing your personal circumstances and your ideas.</p>

        <p>This will allow you to tap into the strengths of your archetype, and really make full use of it to create even closer relations.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a Member. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the wonders and greatness that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of weaknesses and challenges. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Member, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are a social chameleon by your own right - an emotionally intelligent individual who blends into social environments of all shapes and forms.</p>

        <p>You have a special talent for communicating, and breaking language barriers. You're curious about other's beliefs and cultures, and that curiosity is often rewarded with affinity and trust.</p>

        <p>Those personal strengths of your indicate something into your personality profile, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... They indicate that you will uncover fulfillment and joy from being active in a people-oriented role that will require you to do the things that you do best - influence, persuade, and motivate.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you have the makings of an excellent leader. But you must remember to toe the lines of your comfort zone, and eventually, you will learn to break free from the chains of your self-inflicted limitations.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/member-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Member archetype is known to be sweet, attentive, and emotionally available in a relationship... You're thoughtful and courteous  - attributes than any potential suitor would appreciate.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you tend to gravitate towards partners that are more assertive and domineering in a relationship - partners who are willing to take the reigns and dictate the direction.</p>

        <p>That gives you a sense of balance, but in all frankness, that's you selling yourself short - you're able to be assertive and decisive, and you need not limit your sights to individuals who exhibit such traits . You're perfectly capable of taking charge in a relationship, especially after you've explored that side of your identity.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you do tend to assume the more passive role. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that - but you must realize that there needs to be balance in any relationship. There are instances where you must give, as well as take. Likewise, there are also instances where you must follow, as well as lead.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
