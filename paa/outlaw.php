        <p>Dear <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Outlaw! But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.</p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Outlaw, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Outlaw - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Outlaw archetype is notorious, free-minded, and free-spirited...  Nothing stands in your, way and nothing controls your desires. You are the true representation of what it really means to be the captain of your own ship.</p>

        <p>As an Outlaw, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, accountability to others makes you feel trapped, and that's why you prefer to answer to no one. </p>

        <p>Truth be told, the Outlaw archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, The Outlaw archetype is one that tends to go against the grain. You're often challenging the rules and conventions of societal expectations and governmental control.</p>

        <p>You're able to speak with conviction about the things that you're passionate about, and that often includes ultimate freedom and rebelling against authority.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your passion for charitable causes and movements... Whether it's providing stray animals with a home, raising orphans, or building shelters in struggling areas.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/outlaw.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Outlaw archetype, unlike other archetypes, is one that talks the talk, and walks the walk. Your actions and decisions are often reflective of and juxtapose to your personal beliefs.</p>

        <p>That seems to spring from your profound connection to people and things that are lost and forgotten... A connection that ignites a spark in you to create massive change in society - to actualize your vision of a new world.</p>

        <p>Despite your edgy and intense mannerisms, deep down, you're actually someone who's both passionate and compassionate.</p>

        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your thought-provoking insights that spur deep, thoughtful conversations. That's because you're always on high alert when it comes to social issues, injustice, inequality, or practically anything that screams unfairness.</p>

        <p>You do have vigilante tendencies, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... If given the chance to take matters into your own hands, you would not blink twice. That, however, sometimes lands you into trouble.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are the defender of the weak; the one to stand up against bullies, to restore power to the people, and bring justice to those who stole it from them.</p>

        <p>As an Outlaw, you despise systems and all that's attached to it - forming the foundation of your rebel heart, and your formidable spirit.</p>

        <p>Your stance is grounded with conviction, and you have no qualms with putting naysayers in their place. And that conviction is articulated with your passion for the helpless and the hopeless.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, in more ways than one, you have a strong sense of mission - an agent of change, if you will. That stems from your firm belief in the fact that everyone is born equal. And you will do whatever it takes to make it so.</p>

        <p>The Outlaw archetype has a deep-seated connection to the feeble and forgotten. You represent their voice, as well as the need for change in the world.</p>

        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As An Outlaw, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are passionate, extreme, and authentic.</p>

        <p>What you see is what you get with you. There are no hidden sides to you, unlike the other archetypes. That does not mean to say that your archetype is one-dimensional, but it means that you're someone who's rooted in your character and principles, and you're certain about your identity.</p>

        <p>Although you portray yourself as someone relentless and tough, there is a big part of you that's filled with kindness and gentleness - a trait that really shows in your interaction with your love for the people in need of help.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your extreme personality attracts others who are like-minded and share the same sentiments. There's likely only a limited number of people that you choose to spend most of your time with.</p>

        <p>That's because you're intolerant of bigotry, selfishness, and the slightest hint of a discriminatory tone.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, you're also an individual who's altruistic and charitable. You rarely shy away from opportunities to give - as long as you know that the causes you give to are causes that you truly believe in.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, you're best represented by your rebelliousness, your willingness to be different, and your profound sensitivity.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as an Outlaw, you're brave and fearless when it comes to standing up for your beliefs and principles. You could not care less about being judged by others, as long as you stay true to yourself.</p>

        <p>And that translates into the respect that your peers have for you - a representation of your vigour and zeal for living life to its fullest, and leaving it better than when you first found it.</p>

        <p>The Outlaw archetype is driven and motivated by good intentions. Even though others might not understand your intense ideas and uncompromising perspectives, you know for a fact that your heart is in the right place.</p>

        <p>The words that you speak are often inspiring to like-minded individuals, and that stems from your leadership qualities.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you have a boisterous and noticeable presence. Perhaps it's from your choice of clothing or your aura that exudes confidence and boldness.</p>

        <p>Your archetype truly shows when it comes to interacting with strangers, knowing that your opinions will be carefully listened to and that you have the opportunity to change one more person's perspective.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, there are traits of profound leadership that are hidden within you - hidden because they have yet to be fully explored and cultivated. You're able to rally support, and compel people to believe in your cause.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Notorious Outlaw, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your Archetypal strengths and personality traits, , you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>The Outlaw archetype tends to struggle with learning to trust others. And that often forces you to be cynical, skeptical, and suspicious of other's intentions.</p>

        <p>It's likely that you find the same questions repeating in your head, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... About someone else's ulterior motives, about someone else's phony and artificial beliefs, about someone else's trustworthiness as a whole.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, that fear of yours originates from a deeper fear that resides within you... and that is your fear of being vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Perhaps past experiences of betrayal have made you weary of trusting others. However, trust is an important element in life, and an element that you must learn once more in due time.</p>

        <p>It is important for you to learn to be vulnerable and to learn to be hurt - it is through that that you will learn to be stronger, better, and more fulfilled.</p>

        <p>This will allow you to tap into the strengths of your archetype, and really make full use of it to create valuable relationships with people. And in such, you will not feel as alone.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a Member. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the wonders and greatness that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of weaknesses and challenges. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As An Outlaw, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, being vulnerable can be an incredibly scary thought for you... But it’s important to take small steps towards the direction, and make a few minor mistakes along the way.</p>

        <p>This can be applied to both your personal and work relationships.</p>

        <p>The world can be a vicious place if you’re standing alone; even if that thought doesn’t scare you, it should definitely be something worth pondering about.</p>

        <p>You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to combat your cynicism by being more emotionally connected. That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you may have past memories of hurt and betrayal, but through the act of forgiveness, you will soon experience the true, unadulterated freedom that you seek.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/outlaw-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Outlaw archetype is known to be mysterious, passionate, and intruiging in a relationship... You're enigmatic and obscure, and potential romantic partners find that attractive about you.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you tend to gravitate towards relationships that are temporary and short-lived. You're fully committed during the duration that it lasts, but when the flame goes out, you're ready to move on.</p>

        <p>You find it unlikely that you’d want to subscribe to society’s expectations of a typical, traditional marriage - you'd very much prefer to live life according to your own rules.</p>

        <p>However, that might all change if you were to find the perfect partner for you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, even the briefest encounter with you, be it a single night of passion, a short conversation, or even a week of simply being around you, can be refreshing, energizing, and inspiring.</p>

        <p>Your passionate spirit is infectious and full of life, and you are certainly the best at conveying your opinions and ideas with conviction.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
