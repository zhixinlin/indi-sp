        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Ruler, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, You Are The Ruler - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Ruler archetype is best defined by its innate ability to lead. While others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader, Rulers are absolutely comfortable with volunteering to take charge.</p>

        <p>It's important to note that it's not the desire to lead that defines the Ruler archetype, but the actual quality of leadership that you are able to administer.</p>

        <p>Truth be told, the Ruler archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Ruler archetype is best illustrated through the decisions that you make. You are often fair, just, and honourable.</p>

        <p>You're able to manage the expectations of others and grant direction towards maintaining order amongst your friends and various groups of people.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your passion for power and authority... Control is the one thing that you sought after the most, and also the one thing that you find the most fulfilling.</p>

        <p>Everything that you do is always somehow related to either gaining, maintaining, or even exercising control.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/ruler.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, that does not mean to say that you're a control freak. Your approach to idea of control is calculated and methodical.</p>

        <p>More often than not, you leverage on your leadership qualities to attain higher personal goals, be it for their family, friends, or your community 0 and not for senseless or selfish reasons.</p>

        <p>If there's anyone who's capable of pulling that off, it's you, and you know that as well.</p>

        <p>Others find themselves drawn to you because of your assertive and decisive personality.  Within your group of friends, you are often the one calling the shots and organizing outings and gatherings... A trait that others find alluring and attractive about you.</p>

        <p>Needless to say, the Ruler is perhaps one of the most charismatic archetypes, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. After all, you do need a little bit of charisma in order to gain the trust of others.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are also idealistic when it comes to your goals - a strong sign of a visionary. You refuse to fall short of your objectives, and you consider consolation as an indicator of failure.</p>

        <p>As a Ruler, you thrive on creating reliable systems for others to follow.</p>

        <p>Your stance is grounded with conviction, and that conviction is articulated with empathy, kindness, and a giving heart.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your visions are what drive you and motivate you to live life to its fullest. And you refuse to rest until you see your visions through.</p>

        <p>You feel responsible for the others around you - whether they're your friends, co-workers, or even your loved ones. That sense of responsibility pushes you to lead them by example. And that's what ultimately separates you from the wannabes.</p>

        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Ruler, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are inspiring, confident, and determined.</p>

        <p>You might not have a specific expertise or an actual skill set, but as a generalist, you do possess excellent management abilities.</p>

        <p>You're able to delegate and direct others with positive certainty - and that's what makes others willing to follow.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you're not one to shy away from the limelight - being the centre of attention comes natural to you.</p>

        <p>Your keen eye for detail ensures that whatever you set out to do is meticulously executed with precision.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, you're also an individual who's welcoming and open - especially to people who you trust. You rarely shy away from opportunities to play the role of a listening ear, and you feed off information from others to make sincere and unbiased choices.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, as a Ruler, you're gallant and audacious when it comes to taking massive action. Whether it's embarking on an unfamiliar personal journey, or putting a new idea to the test, you're swift to move.</p>

        <p>Unlike other archetypes, you're not one to fear failure - you have a thorough understanding of failure, realizing that it's the next step towards greatness. In fact, you welcome it with open arms.</p>

        <p>You are not afraid to make difficult and unpopular decisions. When you have to put your foot down, you do not hesitate.</p>

        <p>That's because you're willing to put your reputation and image at stake for the sake of your values, and for the good of others.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you tend to be a little bit careful with your choice of words. You prefer to keep yourself censored, and you're always looking for the most politically correct way of putting things.</p>

        <p>You're fully aware that your words have the capacity to hurt or help others, and you'd very much prefer to use them with good intentions.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Decisive Ruler, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your Archetypal strengths and personality traits, , you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>The Ruler archetype tends to struggle with spreading itself too thin. At times, it might feel like you're needed everywhere all at once. It's likely that thoughts of cloning yourself or splitting yourself in half have crossed your mind.</p>

        <p>That challenge often stems from your refusal to seek help from others, perhaps from a lack of trust in the people around you.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, that challenge originates from a deeper fear that resides within you... and that is your fear of losing control.</p>

        <p>Perhaps your obsession with retaining power can at times be unwarranted, or even unnecessary - a self-inflicted belief that has convinced you that power is something that needs to be protected.</p>

        <p>It is important for you to realize that a lack of trust does not resonate well with others, and they do see it as well.</p>

        <p>And that leads us to your greatest challenge of all, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> - and that is overcoming yourself.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a Member. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the wonders and greatness that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of weaknesses and challenges. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, As A Ruler, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, you are an excellent mediator when it comes to managing expectations – those from yourself, and from others. You’re always able to maintain order through your sense of understanding what people want..</p>

        <p>This can be applied to both your personal and work relationships.</p>

        <p>Your talents in discerning right from wrong allows you to concuct fair solutions that are beneficial to all parties involved.</p>

        <p>Your calling in life will revolve primarily around those traits, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. As long as you're able to be in a position where you're able to make fair decisions and provide others with direction, you will find the fulfillment that you seek.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, but you must always remember that your sense of self-worth is not determined by your ability to lead or to rule. In fact, it is important for you to disassociate it completely from your identity.</p>

        <p>In eventuality, that is the true calling that you must answer to.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/ruler-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Ruler archetype is known to be charismatic, assertive, and responsible in a relationship... You often plan ahead of time, and potential romantic partners are often appreciative of that trait.</p>

        <p><span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, but you must be aware that you do tend to come off as authoritative and domineering, which can be challenging attributes to have in a relationship. That often tips the balance in opinions and perspectives, and your partner will have to exercise a lot of patience and humility to constantly submit to you.</p>

        <p>You must bear in mind that relationships are always a two-way street, and the values and opinions of your partner needs to be listened to. Listening to your partner can in fact, be a lot more empowering than trying to impose your authority over him or her.</p>

        <p>It's unlikely that you'll encounter any trouble with finding potential suitors, but if you hold your cards too closely to your chest, you might lose the opportunity to find the one who's right for you.</p>

        <p>With that being said, you must learn to be vulnerable and trusting, and through that, you will also learn to be a more attentive, emotionally present lover. That will translate into a rewarding romantic relationship.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
