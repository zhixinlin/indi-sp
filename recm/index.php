    <div class="recm-reading">
        <p>Before we move on to the final step of receiving your Elemental Paradigm, I want to share with you a little bit more about what I’ve uncovered about you…</p>
        
        <p>Based on what you’ve told me about yourself thus far, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I can tell that you’re someone who truly <span class="purple">values knowledge.</span> Unlike others, you see knowledge is more than just a tool…</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/recm-1.png">
        
        <p>…You understand it to be an <span class="purple">indicator of POTENTIAL.</span></p>

        <p>The more knowledge one has, the greater their potential – that is one of the laws of nature and the universe.</p>

        <p>…And it is through that realization that <span class="purple">wisdom is bestowed</span> upon you.</p>

        <p>I see that part of you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> – its like a <span class="purple">star in your heart</span> that glimmers and beams with pride.</p>

        <p>That is why I’m sharing additional resources with you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… Because unlike others, you’re not one to dismiss the <span class="purple">importance of knowledge and growth.</span></p>

        <p>You’re curious about yourself, and that curiosity drives you to learn more, and more. If there’s any single trait within you that will skyrocket your growth to success, it is your <span class="purple">insatiable thirst for knowledge.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> – allow me to say this…</p>

        <p>There is no greater power than one’s <span class="purple">spiritual energy.</span> I’d like you to ponder upon that for a second – let the words flow off your tongue as if it were your own, personal mantra.</p>

        <p>“There is no greater power than one’s spiritual energy.”</p>

        <p>Dubious? Fret not, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> – I’ll explain what I mean shortly.</p>

        <p>Spiritual energy is no less real than any other form of energy, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… It’s as real as electricity, as nuclear power, as physical strength, as mental dexterity.</p>

        <p>But it’s also <span class="purple">far more significant</span> than any other form of energy…</p>

        <p>…That’s because it’s a form of reiki (or universal life force) – distributed from your soul, and out into the world through the purity of love.</p>
    
        <h2 class="recm-sub-header">Here's How It Works...</h2>
    
        <p>We experience consciousness because of our universal life force… This force is distributed throughout the rest of our body using various channels…</p>

        <p>It flows through our bodies like blood, but not in a tangible or physical manner.</p>

        <p>Think of Chakras, Meridians, and Nadis.</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/recm-2.png">

        <p>Yes, you guessed it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>! This is what <span class="purple">forms the foundation</span> of our vital bodily functions.</p>

        <p>And as you can imagine, any disruption to this flow will <span class="purple">harm</span> our organs, cells, and tissues.</p>

        <p>This is what the study of Reiki is all about, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>…</p>

        <p>It’s about attaining a level of control over your spiritual energy – consciously being able to <span class="purple">raise your vibration levels</span> of this energy field and charging it with positive energy.</p>

        <p>And yes, that’s what ultimately “heals” you…</p>

        <p>Ever wondered why they say that laughter’s the best medicine? <span class="purple">Reiki is the reason.</span></p>

        <p>But healing’s merely scraping the surface – that’s not all that Reiki does.</p>
        
        <div class="bullet-purple">
            <p>It also offers stress reduction and relaxation by triggering the body’s natural healing abilities (immune system)</p>
            <p>It improves your sleeping patterns and overall sleep quality, giving you an energetic and awakened state of mind</p>
            <p>It moulds your mind, body, and soul to experience inner peace and harmony, making it a valuable tool for spiritual growth and self-discovery</p>
            <p>It balances your mind and your emotions, forming the core of what we know as being in a state of tranquility</p>
            <p>It enhances your learning, memory and mental clarity, allowing you to alleviate your mental and emotional being while relieving yourself of negativities such as fear and anger.</p>
            <p>It enhances your capability to love, giving you the courage and transparency to open yourself up to others and improve the relationships that you share with people</p>
            <p>It has the capacity to physically restore your body and provide you with pain relief, especially if you experience migraines, arthritis, or other difficult conditions</p>
