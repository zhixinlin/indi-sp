        <p>What if I told you that you could intentionally <span class="purple">traverse the astral plane…?</span></p>

        <p>What I mean is, what if I told you that you could actually, physically leave your body, hover over yourself, and observe your external environment…</p>

        <p>Think of ALL the possibilities, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>…</p>

        <p>Think about how quickly you’d be able to <span class="purple">accelerate your spiritual awakening.</span></p>

        <p>Think about how life-changing it would be to finally meet your <span class="purple">extraphysical guide.</span></p>

        <p>Think about how <span class="purple">eye-opening</span> the revelations you’d have through such an experience.</p>

        <p>Well, I want you to know, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, that all of that is <span class="purple">ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE.</span></p>

        <p>In fact, it really isn’t so hard to astral project.</p>

        <p>And I want to reveal to you a mere snippet of powerful information that could help you astral project in an instant.</p>

        <p>Just bear with me for a short few minutes, and by the end of this page, you’ll have all the information you need to perform your first astral projection – <span class="purple">EFFORTLESSLY.</span></p>
    
        <h2 class="roap-sub-header">An In-Depth Look Into The Astral Projection Process</h2>
    
        <p>Astral Projection begins when you are in a state of being half asleep… That means the <span class="purple">“in-between zone” of consciousness and unconsciousness.</span></p>

        <p>You may feel paralyzed. You may be aware that you’re lying in bed. Yet, you’re also experiencing a <span class="purple">range of odd, tingling sensations…</span></p>

        <p>And that’s when it happens. You’re suddenly <span class="purple">disassociated from your physical body</span> – floating, even.</p>

        <p>Gravity no longer seems to exist, and your mind’s no longer one with your physical presence… Now, you’re in your “dream body”.</p>

        <p>This is also known as your <span class="purple">spirit or astral body.</span></p>

        <p>As soon as you’re within your astral body, you can now explore your surroundings – your room, your house, pass through walls and windows.</p>

        <p>And then, you’ll grow <span class="purple">infinitely more curious</span> about the potential of this superpower… That’s when you eventually decide to soar above and beyond.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that you can enjoy this incredibly spiritual experience, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>… I can show you how – in just 7 steps.</p>

        <p><span class="purple">Step 1:</span> Relax, both physically and mentally.</p>
        <p><span class="purple">Step 2:</span> Enter a hypnagogic state, or half-sleep.</p>
        <p><span class="purple">Step 3:</span> Deepen the state by prioritizing mental sensation over physical sensation.</p>
        <p><span class="purple">Step 4:</span> Pay attention to the presence of vibration in your environment, which becomes apparent in a state of deep attention.</p>
        <p><span class="purple">Step 5:</span> Incur the vibration in your physical body, and relax into its presence. The purpose of this is to gently jiggle the subtle body out of the physical body.</p>
        <p><span class="purple">Step 6:</span> Focus your thoughts on leaving the limbs and the torso, and try to do so one at a time.</p>
        <p><span class="purple">Step 7:</span> Known as “lifting out,” focus on effortlessly drifting out of your physical body.</p>

        <p>BUT. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this method alone might not do it for you. You see, each of us are programmed differently. Our <span class="purple">consciousness differs from one another</span>, and the methods that we respond to are different as well.</p>
