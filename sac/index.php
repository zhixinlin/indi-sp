        <p>Dear <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>,</p>
        
        <p>I’ve been meaning to get in touch with you, because I’m incredibly excited!</p>

        <p>Why? Well, because I have a <span class="purple">life-altering message</span> to share with you today.</p>

        <p>I know, I know… Perhaps it sounds too good to be true. But believe me, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. This is something you’ll want to see. So, <span class="purple">stay with me</span> now.</p>

        <p>You’ve only recently been introduced to your archetype – The 
    <?php echo $_GET['archetype']; if(empty($_GET)) { echo 'Caregiver'; 
    }?>.         
        </p>

        <p>And you’re probably wondering…</p>

        <p>“How on earth did they know this about me?!”</p>

        <p>It’s flabbergasting, isn’t it?</p>

        <p>Fret not, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. We’re about to reveal <span class="purple">all there is to know</span> about how archetypes work, and exactly what you can do with that information.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header"><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, archetypes represent the <span class="goldenrod">original model</span> of a person...</h2>
        
        <p>…A personality pattern that resides within the <span class="purple">collective unconscious…</span></p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/sac1.png">

        <p>And when we seek to align ourselves to our archetypes, we’ll ultimately attain a <span class="purple">profound and enlightened understanding</span> of ourselves – and the world. Or what we know as, individuation.</p>

        <p>That’s right, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span> – you guessed it! Individuation encompasses literally <span class="purple">all aspects</span> of what it means to be a human being. Whether it’s <span class="purple">health, wealth, or even love!</span></p>

        <p>Imagine possessing an <span class="purple">intrinsic compass</span> within your soul – one that guides you towards making the right choices, and leads you towards a life of <span class="purple">spiritual healing and instinctive guidance.</span></p>
        
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header">Now <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, remember what I said earlier about a <span class="goldenrod">life-altering message?</span></h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/sac2.png">
        
        <p>Well, here it is…</p>

        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You have been chosen.</p>

        <p>You have been <span class="purple">handpicked</span> by the Collective Unconscious to embark on a <span class="purple">journey of epic proportions…</span></p>

        <p>…A journey that will lead to a <span class="purple">lifetime of rewards.</span></p>

        <p>A journey that will elevate you to the realm of <span class="purple">infinite abundance.</span></p>

        <p>A journey of self-discovery, and universal <span class="purple">understanding.</span></p>

        <p>This journey, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, is otherwise known as the <span class="purple">Archetypal Initiation Cycle.</span></p>

        <p>And without even realizing it, you’ve already taken the first step.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you can recall the Archetype Reading that you received, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>And within that reading, I left a few little hints about your destiny.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you’ve picked up on this already. Even if you didn’t, it’s nothing to worry about.</p>

        <p>Because either way, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, regardless of your <span class="purple">thoughts and the decisions</span> that you’ve made, you are exactly where you need to be.</p>

        <p>Right at this very moment, and right at this very second.</p>

        <p>…I know what you’re thinking, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>“I’m not so sure about this… Maybe there’s been some sort of mistake… How do I know if this is even real?”</p>
        
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header">You Were Introduced To Your Archetype For <span class="goldenrod">A Reason...</span></h2>
        
        <p>I trust that you’re familiar with the traits of <span class="purple">spiritual emergence.</span></p>

        <p>Few people have been fortunate enough to be in the position that you’re in right now, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>In fact, few have even had the opportunity to <span class="purple">encounter</span> their archetypes in the first place.</p>

        <p>This is a journey that has the potential to massively <span class="purple">transform</span> your life!</p>

        <p>There exists an intense amount of <span class="purple">archetypal energy</span> deep within your archetype, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>And by embarking on your Archetypal Initiation Cycle, you will be able to tap into that pool of archetypal energy to overcome the <span class="purple">greatest obstacles</span> that stand before you…</p>

        <h2 class="sac-sub-header"><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, That Includes Your <span class="goldenrod">Past, Present, And Future...</span></h2>
        
        <p>I’m sensing that the immediate challenges that stand before you revolve around one thing…</p>

        <p>…A lack of <span class="purple">motion.</span></p>

        <p>Perhaps you’ve achieved everything you’ve wanted in life, and you’re not sure where to go or what to do next.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you’re uncertain about taking a <span class="purple">risk</span> with your relationships or your work.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps you’re even <span class="purple">fearful of the future,</span> which is why you prevent yourself from moving forward.</p>

        <p>You have nothing to fear, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, your Archetypal Initiation Cycle is the <span class="purple">optimal period</span> for you to embark on something new…</p>

        <p>To explore the unexplored.</p>

        <p>It is a period for you to <span class="purple">step out of your comfort zone…</span> To become a better version of who you are, and to grow closer to who you were meant to be.</p>

        <p>…And it all begins with your archetype – The <span class="archetype">Archetype</span>.</p>

        <p>But as the saying goes…</p>
        
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header">“Without <span class="goldenrod">knowledge,</span> action is useless. And knowledge without <span class="goldenrod">action,</span> is futile”</h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/sac-cover.png">
        
        <p>It’s time for you to translate everything you’ve known about your archetype into action, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>
            
        <p>Because I know for a fact that’s your path towards creating life-altering <span class="purple">opportunities</span> for yourself.</p>

        <p>I’ve said this once, and I’ll say it again, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>You are destined for <span class="purple">greatness.</span></p>

        <p>And I have a gift that will lead you towards your destiny…</p>

        <p>…A gift of opportunity, guidance, and revelations.</p>

        <p>Allow me to introduce to you your <span class="purple">Personalized Sacred Archetypal Collection.</span></p>

        <p>This collection comprises 2 <span class="purple">alluring and life-enhancing materials</span> that will help you take the plunge into your archetype, The <?php echo $_GET['archetype']; ?>, and integrate it completely into your subconscious.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header">Your Archetypal Affirmations</h2>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/sac3.png">
        
        <p>One of these materials is the Archetypal Affirmations Guide – a series of <span class="purple">21 potent affirmations</span> that have been customized to your archetype.</p>

        <p>Each affirmation is to be recited each day, and leverages on the optimal period of 21 days for <span class="purple">forming positive habits.</span></p>

        <p>Do not underestimate the power of affirmations, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>Affirmitive actions begin with affirmitive thoughts. And affirmitive thoughts, originate from affirmations.</p>

        <p>Each affirmation in this guide has been masterfully crafted by actualized individuals belonging to your Archetypal family.</p>

        <p>Each sentence and saying has been carefully strung together to be absorbed by your <span class="purple">subconscious,</span> and ingested by your soul.</p>

        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, I have no doubt that the Archetypal Affirmations Guide is the very first step that you must take towards <span class="purple">integrating</span> your archetype into your existence, and continuing the journey of your Archetypal Initiation Cycle.</p>

        <p>…It will annihilate your weaknesses, enhance your strengths, and create <span class="purple">lasting behavioural changes</span> deep within you.</p>
    
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header">Your Archetypal Love Compatibility Guide</h2>
    
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/sac4.png">    
    
        <p>Your archetype isn’t one that struggles with seeing right through people. However, you are sometimes <span class="purple">blindsided</span> by the people you trust most… Betrayed, even.

        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, that’s because your Archetype has yet to be fully integrated into your life, and you’re unable to tap into your <span class="purple">pool of archetypal energy.</span></p>

        <p>And that’s what your <span class="purple">Archetypal Love Compatibility Guide</span> will teach you.</p>

        <p>This is a highly detailed guide that gives you all the information you need to determine how you <span class="purple">interact</span> with people of other archetypes, and whether they’re compatible with you at a fundamental level.</p>

        <p>If you’ve already found <span class="purple">“the one”</span> for you, this guide will give you the exact confirmation you need to know that you’re with the right person; your perfect partner.</p>

        <p>This is a guide that’s unlike any other, and I have no doubt that you will gain <span class="purple">immense value</span> from its insights.</p>

        <p>You’ll finally be able to instantly and accurately recognize potential partners, and sift out the ones whose thoughts, desires, and actions do not resonate with your archetype.</p>

        <p>Imagine all the time and heartache you’ll save! And although the Archetypal Love Compatibility Guide speaks primarily about love, it can also be interpreted and applied to non-romantic relationships as well.</p>

        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, believe me, having all of this information in your backpocket is bound to unlock <span class="purple">sizeable rewards</span> for you…</p>
    
        <h2 class="sac-sub-header">But that’s only if you choose to <span class="goldenrod">trust in the process,</span> <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</h2>
    
        <p>Within the Sacred Archetypal Collection, you will discover (among other things):</p>
        
        <ul class="bullet-purple">
            <li>Exactly what you need to do to become a Master of your archetype – The Caregiver</li>
            <li>Your definitive path towards tapping into your archetypal energy</li>
            <li>The exact steps for you to encounter your archetype at a profound and intimate level</li>
            <li>The most effective way of determining ideal, potential partners in both love and life</li>
        </ul>    
    
        <p>Now, here’s what I want you to do, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>As we’ve already seen from your Archetypal Initiation Cycle, the next 21 days are going to be detrimental to your journey. And the time for you to act is now… Before it’s too late.</p>

        <p>There is no reason for you to wait any longer.</p>
        
        <img class="img-intext" src="../assets/img/sac5.png">    
    
        <p><span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, I want you to imagine the <span class="purple">life of your dreams floating before you...</span> A ball of energy that manifests all of your life’s dreams and desires.</p>
        
        <p>It’s larger than life, more colourful than rainbows, and it glows brighter than the sun…</p>

        <p>A truly magnificent sight to behold, isn’t it, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>?</p>

        <p>…But here’s the thing, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>…</p>

        <p>Each day that you choose to say “no” to an opportunity that allows you to unleash that energy, that ball shrinks. And as it shrinks, it also dims. It grows smaller, and smaller, and smaller…</p>

        <p>…Until it eventually vanishes.</p>

        <p>I know that’s not what you want, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. I don’t want you to be part of the skeptics and the cynics either – because <span class="purple">that’s not who you are.</span></p>

        <p>You are an <span class="purple">optimistic and lively being.</span> I see that in you. I see that in your archetype. In fact, I know that you see that in yourself too…</p>

        <p>You must grasp now before it’s too late, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>.</p>

        <p>In just moments, you can commence your <span class="purple">Archetypal Journey</span> and witness positive events unfold in your days to come…

        <p>The Sacred Archetypal Collection is <span class="purple">not</span> going for $100, even though the information found in this exclusive reading is easily <span class="purple">worth TWICE that amount.</span></p>

        <p>And no, it isn’t even going for the small price of $37. And believe me, there are plenty of readings that are going for that price… Trouble is, those products are lacklustre at best.</p>

        <p>I know that for a fact, because just like you, I’m a <span class="purple">conscious individual</span> who invests in my own personal growth.</p>

        <p>No, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>, the Sacred Archetypal Collection is <span class="purple">not</span> about being lacklustre.

        <p>This offer delivers to you <span class="purple">instant, easy-to-follow, and actionable</span> information that will help you soar to new heights.</p>

        <p>It allows you to leverage on the strengths of your archetype to create lasting behavioural changes, and understand others at a far more detailed and fundamental level.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span class="capitalize"><?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></span>. You can finally <span class="purple">make a breakthrough</span> in your work life, develop even more fruitful relationships, and experience a level of <span class="purple">self-understanding</span> that will open up your heart and mind to the various possibilities that life has in store for you.</p>
